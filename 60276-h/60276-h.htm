<p class="drop-cap">Such were the stranes that smote the air
as Mr. Harold Withersquash drew near
to the humbel home of his Selia. She
was just a low born girl but none could beat
her at playing the piano.</p>

<p>Mr. Withersquash mutered: “She will
do,” and wrapt the door with a clatter.</p>

<p>Now Selia’s ma had shortly done her days
wash, being Tuesday, and she came and
opened the door in a forbidable stile, not being
in the best of moods.</p>

<p><a name="png.006" id="png.006" href="#png.006"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>2<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“What is it now?” snapt she at our hero,
and sniffled in her nose, for she was a rum lady
and corshus as well as cross.</p>

<p>“Ah, good-morning, good-morning,” lisped
Mr. Withersquash in rather a sloppy mode for
to make no mystery she had cut the land from
his feet by her plane ways.</p>

<p>“Selia!” the good woman borled, “Come
on out and never mind your hair-curlers, it’s
only young Withersquash again.” She knew
no better than to be so plane, not having edducation.</p>

<p>“Dezist moddam,” cried Mr. Withersquash,
“and list. My unckle Burt is dead!”</p>

<p>“Him dead, well I never!” the chaste ample
matron replied with a kindly twist at her
handsom broch of platted hares, “What ever
next!”</p>

<p>But now the delicious Selia pushed past her
ma’s elbow, she was a fair rose of Briton,
rather false hair like we see advertised, her
<a name="png.007" id="png.007" href="#png.007"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>3<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>somewhat perfect nose would scarse be
noticed to have been turned up, owing to
sleeping on her stomache, and she wore a nice
dress of white embrery, a good few broches
and some yellow stockings.</p>

<p>“Your unckle dead?” she asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Withersquash grappling her hand in
fierce welcome of joy, replied: “Yes, and he
has left me a good bit.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Harold!” cried our young heroine
pushing more forward, “are you in truth
rich?”</p>

<p>“Well, not so bad,” our little gentleman
replied. “I am quite well to do.”</p>

<p>Selia’s ma now stept off to think this news
over.</p>

<p>“Go on!” uttered Selia in amaze.</p>

<p>“True as I stand here,” ansered Mr. Withersquash making himself very important.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” said she, for if Selia
had a motto it was no nonsense.</p>

<p><a name="png.008" id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>4<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Well,” he said, “I thought as you and me
are a bit third class why not lets go to some
places and get into socierty and have a run for
our money,” and he slapt his manly bosom,
although that was only his way, for he was but
a paltry figure as see in the illustrations, and
emploid at the 6½<i>d</i>. bazaar, nuff said.</p>

<p>“When shall we start?” said Selia, after she
had pondered speedily, for she was one to
loose no time.</p>

<p>“Ah, you will dane to come, will you?”
cried the joyous Mr. Withersquash, and he
added: “We might perhaps get wed later on,
eh?” with a meaning wink.</p>

<p>“Ma, ma!” cried Selia tripping within.
“Mr. Withersquash and me are going off to
get into socierty, pray pack my attire,” for
Selia was always nice in her speech when folks
were about.</p>

<p>While her Ma packed a bag, the young pair
chatered together while Selia wrote a few
<a name="png.009" id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>notes to the boys by way of regret, for she was
a popular girl, and Mr. Withersq stuck the
stamps on.</p>

<p>It was a largish bag in which her Ma
packed her garments, which had been good in
its time, and she put in a nightdress very litel
soiled as the washing was not yet aired not to
say ironed, still it had some ribbons in. Also
she slipped in a nice toothbrush with green
jelly handle, some smelling sope with flannel
for the neck, and an amusing book to read in
bed, entittled Peep of Day as even she knew
that it is very smart to read a bit in bed.</p>

<p>“Fare well, my child,” she uttered with a
tear or two yet smiling at the offspring of her
lions. “And maybe you’ll have changed your
name when we meet again. There’s as good
fish in the sea, you know what I mean,” adding
a sidefaced skowl at Mr. Withersq who truth
to say she didnt set much store by, nor Selia
neither at that time. But the ma thought if
<a name="png.010" id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>her girl could only get out into socierty all
would be well.</p>

<p>Off they went with a wave of the hand to
the adventers in our next.</p>

<h3 title="">CHAPTER TWO
<a name="png.011" id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>7<span class="ns">]</span></span></a></h3>


<p class="drop-cap">“Where in deauce shall we start?” said
Mr. Withersq when they got
round the corner. “We might
suitably have a taxi to start off with.”</p>

<p>“Indeed yes,” simpered Selia as to the
manner born, with a good pull at her garters,
at which the perfunctery Mr. Withersq ran
into the road and he soon found a fresh-looking
taxi. The driver was rather a kindly
man with frizzled beard.</p>

<p>“Now my man, drive us about through some
smart places,” said our hero, blowing in his
cheeks and breathing, but he really felt rather
little because of not yet knowing his way about
the town.</p>

<p>“How would you care for an airing around
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Kensington, for that is a good part my lord,”
said the taxi man.</p>

<p>Mr. Withersq replied “Certenly, certenly,
my good man,” and with a wink of glee at each
other he and his dear wench Selia popped into
the motor.</p>

<p>“What a whiz,” yelled Mr. Withersq as
they poured through the streets.</p>

<p>When they arrived in Kensington, Mr. Withersq tossed the man some money in
silver very lordly, so he drove off highly
gratifyed.</p>

<p>They had a look round.</p>

<p>“This is a bit slow,” said Selia, “I dont
think this is hardly society. Where we live is
very like, only less dogs and the prams not so
sparkly.” For on every side beneath the trees
spanking nurses trundled smart prams tidily
followed by neatly brushed dogs. It was indeed
smart, but of rather a nursery sort, and
not what our pair were out after.</p>

<p><a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Indeed things are a bit slow in Kensington,”
replyed Mr. Withersq. “I tell you
what,” he went on, “we might go to a party.”</p>

<p>“We do not know any,” said Selia, she was
a bit waxy with the vexation and her shoes
had a stone in.</p>

<p>“You know my brother?” asked Mr. Withersq in a honey tone.</p>

<p>“Such folly” snapt Selia, “he isnt the class
to know any partys!”</p>

<p>“Ah,” blushed our hero with a smile,
“that’s were your wrong, for he cleans for the
best, so there.”</p>

<p>“What of it” she snapt, “once a window-cleaner
always a window-cleaner, and you
know well enough that such as him dont go
to partys.”</p>

<p>“This is what of it,” snortled he, for truth to
tell he little liked her scorn. “This is what of
it. My brother tells me there’s a monstrous
party tonight at where he cleaned yesterday,
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with tittled ladys in galore and knites and
what not for the asking, not forgetting
writers and painters and such like.”</p>

<p>“We might try our luck,” said Selia feeling
a bit put down, so on they stept to Soho and
egerly ran into H—— Street. When they
got there, it was the house where Mr. Withersquashes
brother had cleaned, and there was a
piece of spotted carpet out on the footwark,
and you ran up it to the door. The door was
opened and they went in. Selia settled her hat
on the stares, it was one of those kind that
slip and sniggle your hair which is so vexing
as it was rather too large, being a real Paris
shapoh left behind by one of her ma’s lodgers.</p>

<p>O what a bozz of merry crowds from above.
O what a time for our little heros, but Selia
muttered in her throte: “Such is not for any
likes of us.” Even the galant Mr. Withersquash
was half making off, until slapping the
cash in his trouzers pockets with a fine rattel,
<a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he tucked Selia’s elboe in his, and burst into
the room. The babbel ceased, all eyes glowed
upon them.</p>

<p>“My name is Withersquash and this young
lady is Selia,” he cried very loud. “My unckel
Burt is dead, he has left me a good bit. Is it
all right?”</p>

<p>“Oh how charming,” cried the assembly in
shrilly tones and all pressed forward to stare
closer.</p>

<p>They were indeed fine. The ladys in all
manners of colours chiefly oringe and green
idly sipped up rich wine from some mugs,
many smoked without a stop, there were arms
and backs and fronts all bare, some frocks
with tails to them, and some dames wore
trouzer things, very bright and sloppy, much
to Mr. Withersquashes surprise. Several
kinds of men were dotted about, some in evening
close, some like soldiers and many with
long locks or pale fat face as though in grief
<a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which were the artists. The walls however
were done up very high class in coloured
paints and not at all how you would expect in
gentlepeoples places. Such were the scene
and the lights were low.</p>

<p>“And how much did your dead unckle
leave?” kindly asked a magnificent man of
foreign stile.</p>

<p>“Oh a few millions,” replied Mr. Withersquash.</p>

<p>At that the assembly seemed quite cordiel
and all pressed forward to shake hands. A
gent in kaki drew Selia to a well-stuffed couch
altho eyeing her white embrey dress in amaze
and embracing her politely began to have a
nice chat. Mr. Withersq on the other hand
when he saw it was the thing, after a litel also
embrased a few of the lushous women one by
one, but now and then he gave a good wink of
glee over their shoulders to Selia.</p>

<p><a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Ha, ha,” he thought to himself. “Money
always talks.”</p>

<p>Now the gent who had asked Mr. Withersq
how much his unckle left came up to the sofa
on which Selia sat, and leaning on its stuffed
arm, bent and smiled in her eye.</p>

<p>For this the gent in kaki frowned aside,
gnawing his lip for he had little or no
moustache to do it with.</p>

<p>“You have the advantage of me!” cried
Selia coyly to this new face, to which the
foreign newcomer replied in a damp voice:
“I am Tzpcham, the times plastick avetar.”</p>

<p>“How nice!” replied Selia, brightly, at
which he smiled faintly, so she felt they were
getting on. She was always one to want to
quickly pick up the tricks was Selia.</p>

<p>“My name is Selia,” she added, with a soft
giggle for his sake.</p>

<p>But now a dazzling noble with diamond
<a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>studs and slippery shoes in a hard-boiled front
like you see in laundrys came up murmuring
“Pleasure!” and then gripping Selia round the
back, stood her on her feet. Once more the
gramyphone struck up, and they began to jig
about to its notes, as happily Selia guest when
stood on her feet that this was the thing to do.
She could not dance very well, but it did not
matter as there was little room to do more than
shuffel.</p>

<p>“Isnt she charming,” cried the ladys which
made Mr. Withersq burn with pride. Not to
be outdone he seezed the largest lady round
the centre. She had a silk stocking tied round
her head, which is very smart for evening wear,
and they began to have a bit of a caper also,
and cries of approval arose in a polite way
from all assembeled.</p>

<p>“What a pant!” yelled Mr. Withersq, but
he kept at it, knowing that to dance was the
craze of the hour. Round and round they
<a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>went, and more and more couples joined in
until all jammed together they trudged and
shuffled to the music in the hot room.</p>

<p>When they at last stopt all out of breath
and gasping, the lights got a bit lower and the
largest lady what he had since popt on a chair
got up and stood in the centre of the room but
all the others sat down on the floor or the
sofars and lapped up some more wine to take
the dust out of their throats.</p>

<p>The fat lady now undid her flowing cape
and dropped it down, very lighthearted,
draped as she was in a quantity of muslin,
rather limp perhaps, but striking, and then she
took off her slippers, and already having no
stockings on was now barefoot and began to
dance and show off in the middel of the room,
tied round the haunch with gold stuff, and
waggeled and bobbed herself about to the
notes of the gramafone.</p>

<p><a name="png.020" id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Ecquisist,” howled the crowd of lovely
folk, “What form divine!”</p>

<p>“What is she at?” growled Mr. Withersq
for to tell the truth he felt a bit queer, this
being in the nature of a surprise, and hoping
that this was not a thing to copy, not feeling
too sure of the last time he washed his feet.</p>

<p>“Hussssh!” hissed a shriveled dowager
beside him, “it is her art.”</p>

<p>Now the fat lady at last ceased dancing and
sank down, and a beaky-nosed sort of gentleman
cried out: “Our newly-come friend
Withersq does not seem to understand.”</p>

<p>“Dont be a soft!” cried Selia, for she had
guest he had put his foot in it by his remark,
remembering what her ma had taught her that
no true ladys and gentlemen ever took notice
or seemed amazed but took things as in a
dream without saying much.</p>

<p>Now while all this turmoil went on, the
ladys cried several times “How two to!” and
<a name="png.021" id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Arent they two sweet?” and “Oh, <em>no</em>!” like a
perfect choir, which Selia and Mr. Withersq
hardly knew how to take.</p>

<p>The sharpnosed gent before long rose to his
feet with a bored sniff.</p>

<p>“Art, my dear friend, is but a long sigh for
the beautiful and great,” he drorled, and
bursting into tears he left the room and was
seen no more, and the ladys said he was
charming too.</p>

<p>Selia now ventured to wisper to the young
person beside her on the floor: “Why did he
cry? What has he done wrong?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dont ask me, I am only a meer
countess and no nothing of artists and their
ways,” this beauty replied with an haughty
smirk.</p>

<p>“I see,” politely said Selia, although she did
not really, but feeling very improved to be on
speaking terms with a countess so soon.</p>

<p>And now came another nice little event.
<a name="png.022" id="png.022" href="#png.022"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The man Tzpcham having quaft several bouts
of the costly wines sudenly stept forward
tossing back his hairs and then like a conjurer
he pulled from his coat a thing like a football
stuck on one side of a plate, only all made in
one out of stone, and it was really a statue. It
was a surprise for Selia and Mr. Withersq, as
they had only seen statues before that were
like people.</p>

<p>“It is my latest,” cried Tzpcham, and the
brite ladys and the men bent and cooed round
it making noises of pleasure.</p>

<p>“All art is the round getting the best of the
plain,” said he then in a gloomy way shaking
his head.</p>

<p>“How too true!” cried Selia gushingly, for
she was a quick girl and had picked up this
smart saying by now, and drew murmurs of
admiration from all beholders.</p>

<p>By this time of night, all the assembly had
drunk many drinks and so very soon they lay
<a name="png.023" id="png.023" href="#png.023"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>down in ordely heaps and pairs on the floor or
the sofars to sleep it off, and when Selia and
Mr. Withersquash had said their prayers they
lay down too, Selia with her head softly rested
on her bag, and dropped quickly off to sleep
very well pleased with the way they had got
on, and that was the end of the party.</p>

<a name="png.024" id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p class="drop-cap">In the morning it was Selia that woke Mr. Withersq.</p>

<p>“Come on Harold,” she said rising from
her makeshift couch, “we know some art now,
lets make a move.”</p>

<p>“My pet,” cried the delited Mr. Withersq,
“You have called me Harold. Ah me ah me
how fondly I love your charms,” and so he
picked up Selia’s bag, and they went out
stepping over the countess and ran into the
street. Selia still a little red from her blush at
Mr. Withersquashes warm words of passion.</p>

<p>“What about a bit of food?” she said to
change the subject.</p>

<p>“Ah, now I will give you a fair treet,” cried
Mr. Withersq brindling with glee, “for
<a name="png.025" id="png.025" href="#png.025"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>indeed I love you at last Selia and you shall
ate of the best now Unckle Burt is dead.”</p>

<p>“Pray how shall such as us know where to
eat of the best?” scoffed Selia lightly for she
had yet to learn how to treet a good noble man
with properness.</p>

<p>“Now dont be snappy,” said Mr. Withersq
who was not to be put down so easily. “It was
a baroness herself last night who asked me if
I offen went to the Mauve Loft, and she said
it was ripping, so not so much of your scorn if
you please.” So you see even our devoted Mr. Withersq could turn, which is not to be surprised
at seeing he had unbroken his fast.</p>

<p>“What is the Mauve Loft?” snapped Selia,
“what kind of a place I ask. Fletchers I
know, and the Dad goes to Pim’s when he
back’s a good ’un, but what is a Loft? Tell
me that!”</p>

<p>“It is where you eat if you are smart” responded
her Harold. “You should know by
<a name="png.026" id="png.026" href="#png.026"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>now that the upper ten call their eating places
by names, like dogs or pubs. Have you not
yet heard of the ‘Spotted Eel?’ at Chelsy?
Nor the ‘Monkey Puzzel’ at the Scrubs?
Tush, Selia, pull your socks up my good girl.”</p>

<p>They strode forward in glassy silence.</p>

<p>When they got there it was over some
stable-places in Piccadilly and they went up
the ladder and tapt. A totally black nigger
let them in and bowed, and they entered and
Mr. Withersq giggled the cash in his trowsers
for all he was worth as was by now his lucky
custom.</p>

<p>It was a terrific abode painted a purpel
colour which looked very nice. And across
the mantelpece was printed very big</p>

<p class="ctr">LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS</p>

<p class="noindent">which I think is from Shakespeare.</p>

<p>There was hundreds and dozens of waiters
all totally black teeming about the room, and
<a name="png.027" id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>all along the floor stood a great tabel like in
pictures of the last supper. Many smart people
sat rather sprawly at it and listened to the
words of a man very similar looking to those
Mr. Withersq and Selia had beholded the
night before at the party. And meanwhile
they chewed their food. Also several young
ladys some soberly in round black specs but
some also a bit dashing with scarlet lips and
several oldish ones too, all lolled on the table
on elbows and smoking like chimneys.</p>

<p>As our coupel entered they turned of
course and had a good stare but said nothing,
not knowing them. Nothing abashed Mr. Withersq beckoned a couple of black waiters
to bring the food list which they did.</p>

<p>He chose a good few of the dearest things,
trusting to be correct, and they sat down at
the foot of the table, hoping to chum up
quickly.</p>

<p>The waiters brought first some halfs of
<a name="png.028" id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fruits like lemons only bigger on plates but
Selia hated hers and popt it under the tabel.</p>

<p>“Bring me some grilled kidneys and look
sharp,” she commanded very grandly.</p>

<p>Now all this time she and Mr. Withersq
had been shuffling on their seats and making a
few friendly grimaces toward the large party
lower down the tabel, and doing such tricks
as half smiles and looking as if they were going
to nod in a tick. Yet the cold hump was
all they got from that crowd gathered around
the faint-looking man in the centre.</p>

<p>“You cant hardly say we’re making much
of a hit here,” said Selia crossly: “You should
have said your unckle Burt was dead. Try
and get the nasty stuck up lot to talk, wont
you?”</p>

<p>So at this Mr. Withersq mustered his heart
up a bit and rapt on the tabel with a spoon
until all looked towards him. “Hallo” he said
to them all. “My unckle Burt being dead has
<a name="png.029" id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>left me a few millions so why not be sports and
chum up, eh?”</p>

<p>Oh what an icy bath our little friends then
got from the stares of those ladys and men.</p>

<p>“I am Boom,” said the faint-looking man
stroking his long hair with unction. “I do not
think you are one of us. You do not understand.”</p>

<p>“O come!” cried our hero, getting his back
up a bit although Selia was tramping on his
feet under the festive board’s legs. “We are
quite new to the game, I know, but for all that
we know a countess or two. Be a sport old
chappy. Let me tell the blackie to get you a
coffee if you dont care for anything stronger.”</p>

<p>He thought those were two safe things to
say, but he was also puzzeled by their looks
towards him and more towards Selia whose
rayment was so utterly not like theirs, and
more so that her white robe was a bit dashed-looking
with the rough night she had had.</p>

<p><a name="png.030" id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Ah,” cried the young ladies in a voice like
pidgeons, and the old ladies and the man.
“How balderdash!” And they turned their
faces away.</p>

<p>Selia let fall a scalding tear and ordered
some pooched eggs to keep up her strength.
At which Mr. Boom and his attending ladies
got up hortily and stamped out very conseated
which upset our couple largely.</p>

<p>“Bear up sir,” cried a black waiter kindly.
“It is only their way being a school of poetry.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Selia blowing her nose, “I
would like to go to such a school, wouldnt you,
Harold, though not to their nasty stuck up
one, eh?”</p>

<p>“In sooth, yes,” he answered with effervessence.
“It would be very useful to us I am
sure, to deal with such strumpets and aristocracy.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, if you will excuse me,” put in the
waiter now beaming like a holy angel with his
<a name="png.031" id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sooty features. “You will soon be all right.
There are just the little matters like eating
and that which are very catchy and the right
words to say.”</p>

<p>“<!-- TN: opening quote invisible -->You see this lot thats just gone out are all
very artful people, who speak to no one but
print little books of their poems all the while,
and wont sell them to anybody at all, and that
makes them very slippery customers to deal
with, as no one knows what they are really at,
and mean too,” he added, looking beneath their
plates where a solitary sixpence graced the
deserted board.</p>

<p>“Take that my good negro” cried Mr. Withersq slipping a green paper money in his
quaintly coloured palm.</p>

<p>So when they had looked up an address in
the book, they set out for a nice school where
to learn poetry and so climb.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter Four"> </h2>
<div class="chapta">
<h3 title="">CHAPTER FOUR<a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]</span></span></a></h3>



<p class="drop-cap">There was the bust of a dog in the front
yard of the school of poetry and the
door was pink.</p>

<p>“You ask,” said Harold Withersq to Selia
his love. “For this is a bit of a treat for you,”
so she rang the brass bell and got her mouth
ready to pop the question to the serving maids.
A grand old woman in a white pinny came and
opened.</p>

<p>“Pray conduct us to your owner,” said
Selia in a wonderful chic voice. “We have
come to join the school.”</p>

<p>The woman showed them into a white hall
with two rows of littel coloured pictures
painted on glass of chinamen and tigers very
bright and instructing hung all down the
sides. Mr. Withersq now puffed himself out
<a name="png.033" id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ready for the encounter. The old lady bobbed
on before them down the white hall to a large
chamber like a chapel with gold-edged pictures,
some of Nude in galore, and twenty
grown up young people sat in desks in this
hall, scribbling on slates under the watching
eye of a bald man mounted up on a littel platform
at the top. All the bottom on his face
was beard and his mouth made you laugh
when he talked like looking at a person’s
mouth talking upside down. And he had
glasses with brown rims and ear-bits very costly
and wise looking.</p>

<p>The twenty pupils raised their heads and
stared.</p>

<p>Mr. Withersq stept boldly up to the
teacher and laid a pound note on his desk.</p>

<p>“I have been insulted,” he cried waving his
arms a little though not much out of respect,
“my unckle Burt is dead and has left me a
good bit. This is my girl Selia.”</p>

<p><a name="png.034" id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
Selia gave a bow and muttered pleased to
meet you.</p>

<p>“We are seeing life,” Mr. Withersq went
on after this little interruption. “We have
been to a party and danced and slept with the
very creme of London, baronnesses and what
not, and yet not an hour ago I was insulted.
The creture that is called Boon gave me the
bird and my Selia too, because he is so proud
to be a poet. Make me a poet, make my lady
a poet too if you can, and I will pay you well
and pay them out.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” said the teacher. “You
arent allowed to have quarrels before you’ve
been printed so you both sit down and see what
you can do.”</p>

<p>So they sat down both and had a stare at the
others. They were again mostly like the beings
at the party, but more younger men very
drooping in figgur and unshorn heads, some of
<a name="png.035" id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>whom munched drugs out of boxes while they
worked, to keep their spirits up.</p>

<p>“They look a bit half-baked,” Selia remarked
to Mr. Withersq and drew a frown
from the teacher.</p>

<p>“Write me now a good poem to the bakers
horse” shouted he from his littel platform
tossing slates to Selia and Mr. Withersq and
all present began to scribble and squeek on
the slates at which the good teacher pluckt
hairs from his beard and smiled in a nodding
sort of way like a grandma. Selia and Harold
gave a sorry look at each other not knowing
how to put bakers horses into poetry and
thinking up till then that poetry was all rich
like creamy cakes with love and nobel roman
deaths for the schools they had went to taught
nothing else. So they dotted down a few
words hoping to pass in the crush.</p>

<p>Selia <span class="nw">wrote:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div>Oh horse of the daily baker

<div>Why is that</div>
<div>Oh horse?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and left it at that.</p>

<p>The other pupils were scratching away on
every side and she began to have douts and
very likely as not she ought to have gone to a
lower class but the teacher had guest by the
air of her hat that she knew more than she did.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this a go?” whispered Mr. Withersq
to her. “I cant half write poems, Selia, you
just wait,” for he guest he had put his foot on
the road to success.</p>

<p><a name="png.037" id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“How perfect dear Harold” she whispred
a bit madly for she had made a mess of it
herself. “You can indeed shine before the
duchesses and perhaps that will do the trick.
You wont forget me then will you, dear
Harold?” For she was if anything even
keener than him to get on, and did not want
to be left behind, for though she knew how
the millions helpt she guest there was more to
it than that.</p>

<p>“Bring up your slates my poor clods of
pupils,” cried the teacher looking vext.</p>

<p>Two girls in gowns of patterns like chair
covers swooned off, which was very successful
and nicely done.</p>

<p>“That’s the emoshun,” a snaky-faced chap
whispered behind his hand to Selia.</p>

<p>Another chap who might have been own
brother to the nawseous Mr. Boon crackt his
slate on his desk and scrumbled the bits on the
floor.</p>

<p><a name="png.038" id="png.038" href="#png.038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Sir,” he cried, “my poem is too fair for
the eyes of the herd.”</p>

<p>The teacher pluckt his beard harder
greatly taken by this swanky touch, and was
going to give the prize to that chap until of a
sudden Mr. Withersq sprang airily forward
crying in a pulpit voice: “Read mine!”</p>

<p>He had <span class="nw">wrote:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

That was the poem Mr. Withersq had
wrote, he thought of it because of some
cinemas he used to see.</p>

<p>The teacher seazed his head between his
hands and beat it madly on his desk and
shreiked very loud.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he gasped as though washing in cold
water, “this is immense, this is a charming
poem, ah me, ah me, it is truly wonderful!”</p>

<p>And he wept tears.</p>

<p>The other pupils oped wide their eyes, and
heard him, and lept up crying “Ah yes,
charming, wonderful, what forse what words
what pictures what simpelness,” or something
like that. Many came and kissed Mr. Withersq and burst on all sides into sobs.
There never was such a scene. Selia meanwhile
sat chewing her handky not knowing
what to make of it though Mr. Withersq sent
her a sly wink from time to time as though to
say that her time was yet to come.</p>

<p><a name="png.040" id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
The teacher still beating his head on the
desk now became devilishly excited and
furiously rang a large hand bell which he
drew from within.</p>

<p>“What is it, what is it?” cried Selia to the
glory-smothered Mr. Withersq.</p>

<p>“God knows,” replyed our hero, “but I
think I have done the trick.”</p>

<p>On the wringing of the bell feet were heard
to be approaching and many doors opened in
the near distance. The door burst and many
clever poetry teachers of the school followed
by their pupils came hurrying in and rushed
at Mr. Withersq where he stood beside the
teacher modestly spottled with sweat and pawing
at Selia’s unwilling hand.</p>

<p>“A new poet, a new poet!” they all yelled,
dancing with glee around the desk.</p>

<p>First came a man with scarlet face and flannel
suit and spotted tie, rather after the
fashion of those you give slips of paper to at
<a name="png.041" id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>street corners about the races. He was followed
by a class of sturdy men some like
sailors and some very artful looking prinking
on their legs as they came, and all of these
spoke bad words.</p>

<p>“That is the limerick class,” wispered the
head teacher to Selia.</p>

<p>An absent faced teacher with a lock over his
eyes now rushed in crying: “Where is the
lad, where is he that I may press him to me?”
and when with a fine gestur the head teacher
pointed to Mr. Withersq this man rushed to
him and hugged him up and so did the limerick
chaps too after that, because the absent
teacher was a very great Irish poet.</p>

<p>Then followed the rhyming class, very
young poets these were, and after them
trooped in a class mostly of bitter old fashioned
ladys and a few clericels who wrote
poetry deadling with the soul and Sunday.
Then came an image class of more foreign
<a name="png.042" id="png.042" href="#png.042"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>appearance, who were learning how to say odd
things, and their teacher was a Dane from
Denmark. Then came the lot that wrote sonnets
which is very tricky work, who all wore
blazers and white trowsers because they had
been to Oxford and their hair though curly
was pleasantly soaked in smelly oils, not like
the uncurbed heads of the former poets who
had entered.</p>

<p>All these folks came busling in and many
were the pleasant and curious garbs they
sported, pleeted trousers, full puffy trousers,
thin trousers tied under the boot, not to mention
vegetated wastcoats or no wastcoats at all
with very fancy shirts like ladys blouses, and
all wore or carried hats such as were never I’m
sure seen in Dunns, which is a hat shop.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Harold Withersq,” now cried
the head teacher when they had all entered,
“whom our enemys Emilian Boom and company
have chosed to heap insults on seeing he
<a name="png.043" id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was a stranger. His unckle Burt is dead and
has left him a good bit of money. And now
he has gone and written a most wonderful
poem. Our good sonnet teacher is at this
moment speaking on the phone to the Minister
of Education at Buckingham Palace to ask
him if he will have him made our new head
poet.”</p>

<p>“Here here,” muttered the gathering, at
which the eyes of Mr. Withersq lighted up
and he gave a fresh grip on Selia’s hand.</p>

<p>The sonnet teacher now came from the telephone.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the head teacher. “What
does the minister say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s popped up stairs to ask His
Majesty the King please to make Mr. Withersq head poet.
I told him that Mr. Withersquashes unckle Burt is dead, so I expect
it will be all right.” By this he meant
that money talks.</p>

<p><a name="png.044" id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
Tinkle, tink, the telephone called out. The
sonnet teacher went back to it.</p>

<p>All the assembly had their ears out for
what he said on it.</p>

<p>“Hello? Oh yes, its the school of poetry.
Yes. Oh, you say the King will be very glad
to have a fresh poet? That’s good. I see.
Goodbye!”</p>

<p>As he put down the hear-piece, a gruff cheer
burst from the poets filling the room. The
head teacher held up his hand. Silence followed.</p>

<p>“His Majesty the King says he could well
do with a fresh poet,” he announced, “and I
am sure you will all agree that our new friend
Mr. Withersquash is a very suitable one for
the job. I therefore here and now award him
the head poet of England. Three cheers for
him. Go it, boys!”</p>

<p>“Ah ah” they screemed. “Hurrah-hurrah-hurrah!
That is charming!” All the young
<a name="png.045" id="png.045" href="#png.045"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>lady poets and all the young gentlemen poets
jumped for joy because the new poet had
sprung from their school.</p>

<p>The teachers and classes now drew in a ring
round our hero clasping his Selia. The old
lady servant who had opened the door to our
heros now entered bearing a golden hat-box
which she presented with a touching curtsy
to the head teacher. He soon whipped off the
lid, and drew forth an object mufled in
crinkeld paper.</p>

<p>“Ooh!” breathed all present, sucking in
their breaths.</p>

<p>Off came the crinkeld paper, and the bald
bearded teacher drew forth a sweet little
crown, all made of leaves, and bending over,
slipped it on top of Mr. Withersquashes head.</p>

<p>“That is until his dear Majesty the King
has time to ask him to the Palace,” said he and
kissed him a lot very sloppy and would have
kist Selia but Mr. Withersq said not.</p>

<p><a name="png.046" id="png.046" href="#png.046"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
All the crowd had a good clap and were very
excited, for you see Mr. Withersq had wrote
the best poem of the top class of the swankiest
school of poetry in Briton and had been made
head poet for his trouble which is how those
things are done and they choose a new one
every few years or so when the old ones get
stale.</p>

<p>But Mr. Withersq took the bun by laying
his littel crown of leaves at Selia’s feet with a
low bow (not wishing to go out in the street
with it on) after which he hung it on one arm,
and taking Selia on the other they walked
forth amid the admiring throng waving them
a harty goodbye.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“Now,” said Selia, “what about a bit
of food?”</p>

<p>These words although not intended
to be were overheard by two of the
pupils from the school who had also come out.</p>

<p>“Oh pray have a snack with us” said the
plumper one, “I am Gerald Majpottel and
this is my brother Rupert. Our father is a
lord. We are in the satire class, we write a
good few poems and move among the very
best.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” replied the hungry Selia,
“we shall be delited to come thanks.”</p>

<p>So they slipped all four into a taxi and very
soon arrived at the Majpottels house in Park
Lane, a tall place with green blinds, behind
<a name="png.048" id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>whose covert pink housemaids flitted and
peeped in galore, beneath the swey of a handsom
butler who was proudly figetting with the
blind tassel in the diningroom window.</p>

<p>Chucking one of the pretty housemaids
under the chin Gerald Majpottel and his
young brother led Mr. Withersq within and
politely told them where to wash their hands.</p>

<p>The bathroom was on top of the stares and
very smart being all lined through with pink
and blue tiles. The rich looking bath was pink
china, almost enough to have a swim in with
a few neat texts stampt on it to wile away the
time while soaking, and a pretty mat saying
“BATH” to step out on to after.</p>

<p>“Oh, behold” cried Selia to Mr. Withersq
who was doing his nails with a pin while she
wiped up above the wrists. For they had the
makings of good stuff although of humbel extract.</p>

<p>“Look dearest Harold how very chaste, in
<a name="png.049" id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>this little cupboard are the under attires of our
hosts, arent they indeed smart?”</p>

<p>Mr. Withersq fainting with jealousy replied:
“Oh Selia, they are indeed modish,
how lucky we struck with them, perhaps they
will teach us a few wrinkles to success.”</p>

<p>For in the airing cupboard by the bath reposed
elegant heaps of under attire. On the
right hand side beneath a little card printed
“Gerald” was a great pile of blue ones made
some of finest fleece and some of silk both
vests and other things while behind these
lurked shirts in hues of pale and bright tones
very tricky indeed. On the left was a similar
heep only with a card saying “Rupert” and all
these were pink the same.</p>

<p>“See,” cried Selia, “they are all marked in
sewn letters with their own names, and a little
crown above. Isn’t it pretty? That is because
their father is a lord you know.”</p>

<p>“Ah yes,” sighed he, “how too-too!” for he
<a name="png.050" id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>46<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had caught that saying up by now. “Selia!”
he went on madly, “I too must go as soon as
we’ve got through the food and buy some
things like theirs in dozens, and I shall have
Withersquash wrote on in sewn letters being
smarter than Harold. Never never before
did I know the shame of only having two of
everything one to wear and one to wash until
I peeped into this splendid wardrobe!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you must indeed,” Selia agreed, “and
why not have a neat little “£sd” done underneath
like they have their little crowns done,
that would surely be a pretty touch seeing you
are a millionaire!”</p>

<p>“Selia, my own!” cried he, “you have said
it! And it shall be done and you shall have
some attire too for your pretty thought!”</p>

<p>She was so glad at these words that she
poked about a bit more in the cupboard and
what did she espy but two littler piles of close
all as white as snow with a little card over
<a name="png.051" id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>them saying “Sunday.” That finished Mr. Withersq and he slid down the bannisters after
her, they were so pleased with things, to the
room where the Majpottels were waiting.</p>

<p>Five of the pink housemaids were dojjing
round the table which was nice and large and
full of good food in plenty.</p>

<p>“Pray be seated,” cried Gerald, “and fall
too.” He was a nice sleek young man with
black slick hair and talked as though with
sweets tucked in the mouth.</p>

<p>So they all sat and ate beef and batter and
peas for a start.</p>

<p>“How nice your room is,” said Selia through
the food she had stuffed in her mouth.</p>

<p>“Is it not?” modestly replied Rupert, then
he went on: “Our colours are good are not
they?” at which Selia and Mr. Withersquash
both nodded a good many times over and ate
some more.</p>

<p>The room was a grand site indeed, crimson
<a name="png.052" id="png.052" href="#png.052"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and scarlet and red and vermilion, very odd,
with purpley curtains like pretty ink.</p>

<p>“And what do you think of our fireplace?”
went on Rupert, blinking his green eyes.</p>

<p>It was all made of white stone carved out
into dogs and monkeys and things like that
with a great face in the middel, twinkley drop
things of sparkling glass stood at each end of
it and a gold clock in the middel under a
shade.</p>

<p>“That is very nice,” politely replied Selia.</p>

<p>“Yes, it cost a good bit,” Rupert said.</p>

<p>He then past them some salmon done up
with bits of egg and greenery and they ate
that, and then some ham with hot pickels, and
then some nice boiled pudding with jam on
it and some frute tart with blobs of stiff cream
and a few ices after (wrapped up in lace
paper they were too), and some very costly
kinds of fruits like aprycots and grapes which
they washed down with every kind of wines
<a name="png.053" id="png.053" href="#png.053"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and beer for as soon as Selia and Mr. Withersquash
had emtied a glass of wines or beer a
pink housemaid came and filled it up again,
because the butler who was leaning against
the wall at the back told them to. But the
brothers Majpottel ate almost nothing which
is a very polite thing to do, and in that case
you have it in the pantry or up in your bedroom
later on.</p>

<p>When they had eaten all they could they
pushed back from the tabel and had a bit of
talk.</p>

<p>“And are you glad now, dear Withersq that
you got made head poet?” asked Rupert in a
polite tired voice.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, that I am” said Mr. Withersq,
“for I dearly want to get on.”</p>

<p>“And so do I,” lisped Selia “although it is
not all plane sailing, alas.”</p>

<p>“Come, brother,” cried Rupert Majpottel
<a name="png.054" id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to Gerald with kind condescencion. “Why
not lets help this young pair.”</p>

<p>“Why yes,” replied Gerald, “they must fix
up some more brite idears like the poetry and
become famous for that is the way to shine,
and get on, if you are not born to the manner.”</p>

<p>Mr. Withersquash was feeling a bit sick but
he cheered up now and enquired the way to
make the smartest baronesses and such to take
notice. “You see, dear sir,” he said, “I would
very much like to ask Miss Selia to become
Mrs. W. but I cant very well until I know
where I am, can I? Eh?”</p>

<p>Selia was overcome with blushes, for she
had learnt to love her Harold by now, and
very much fancied herself as his wife, though
this was the first he had said of it.</p>

<p>“It is all right for you,” replied Rupert,
“seeing you have come in to a good bit of
money and are now the head poet, although
<a name="png.055" id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not quite the thing in some ways if I may say
so without offence.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Mr. Withersq. “What
you mean is that Selia must have her bit of
success too, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” said the brothers, “it is a hard
world for the ladys if they are not quite the
thing, and you see when a lady is a wife, she
must be up to all the ways of the world else
she looks a bit silly doesn’t she, and people
dont come to see her you know, which is rather
a bore.”</p>

<p>“Give us a few handy tips,” said Selia for
she was not so stuck up but what she was
willing to try and go one better.</p>

<p>“Well to begin with you must get a few
clothes, such as fur coats and some nice evening
togs and some long narrow shoes,” said
Rupert rather thoughtfully. “If you go to a
good shop the ladys there will tell you what
you ought to have.”</p>

<p><a name="png.056" id="png.056" href="#png.056"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Why yes” said she gleefully, “Harold you
shall buy me all those and some good hats and
a gold-stalked umberella.”</p>

<p>“Certenly, certenly” replied the good Mr. Withersq.</p>

<p>“Then you might try talking in that boomy
voice we use” Gerald took up the tale, “and
try and look a bit fed up with things, you
know, but that isnt really all, for you simply
must be a bit of a toff at something or other
and then the baronesses will notice and remember
who you are which is the great idear.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure” replied Selia with a hiccup
from the stout she had had, “but what had
I better do? I am only a simple girl, and
know very little.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to that?” Mr. Withersq
asked the brothers with a scratch at his nose,
“I hardly know what to suggest myself.”</p>

<p>“Do you sing?” Gerald asked.</p>

<p>“No” said Selia dully.</p>

<p><a name="png.057" id="png.057" href="#png.057"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Cant you do anything besides play the
piano?” asked Mr. Withersq.</p>

<p>“Oh! The piano! Dont ever let anyone
know you can play that!” warned Gerald.
“That is a very low thing to do. The banjo
or the cello if you like but not the rotten
piano!”</p>

<p>“Let us think,” said Mr. Withersq. “What
would be the best thing for her to do?”</p>

<p>“Well now, let us think then” agreed the
brothers Majpottel tipping back their chairs.
“There is politics but it would be too long
before she got in the cabinet and perhaps also
she would never get in at all. She cant very
well go in for science, seeing she doesn’t know
any, she cant very well become a painter nor
even a dressmaker because she dont know how
to dress herself. I dont really know what she
<em>can</em> do.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, oh dear!” wailed the poor girl
and dropped into Mr. Withersquashes bosom
<a name="png.058" id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for comfort, all the pride had gone out of her
now.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity she isnt a sporty girl,” muttered
Rupert half to himself for he had taken a liking
to his humbel friends and could not bear
to see her weep.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” shreiked Selia darting
like an asp from Mr. Withersquashes embrace.
“A sporty girl? Me? Who says I’m
not? Aint I got the challenge cup for the
Hoxton tennis club three years running?
Aint I the best roller skatist they ever seen at
Holland Park? Say I’m not sporty?”</p>

<p>“Tennis?” yelled Gerald and Rupert together,
till one of the vanished housemaids
put her head round the door thinking she was
wanted.</p>

<p>“Yes” yelled back Selia, “and why not?”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” the two lordly
brothers cried. “That’s a good girl! You’ll
be the success of the season if your pashent”
<a name="png.059" id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and then chatter chatter they went making
plans for Selia’s springing her talents on the
smart world, which would make it possible for
Mr. Withersq to wed her without her getting
the cold shoulder as a matron.</p>

<p>It was settled at last that the brothers
should arrange for her first appearance.</p>

<p>“Very well” said Selia, “thank you. You
may rely on me to do my best. Come on
Harold we must go to the shops.”</p>

<p>“Goodbye dear friends” said Gerald rising
very elegantly to lead them to the door “and
thank you for coming. Mind and brush up
your sports now Miss Selia and get some
suitable raiment for the great day and we will
shew them the stuff you are made of.”</p>

<p>“Very good” said Selia at the door, “and
you see if we dont make a splash in socierty
with a vengeance.” With these words she and
Mr. Withersq went off and that is all that
happened there.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">They popped quickly together into
Bond Street. A tall man like a
sarjent stood graveley at the door of
the shop Mr. Withersq led his love to, and
this tall man pretended to be undoing the door
of a motor car when he saw them stopping at
the door, and offered Selia his arm as if she
was stepping out of her car and then led her
up to the door as though she were someone although
she had simply come on foot.</p>

<p>Once inside a lordly person in evening
dress came swimming up with joined hands
and said “What, please?” with a low bow.</p>

<p>Mr. Withersq said very loud: “Underthings”
so this gentleman led them through
beautiful saloons of costly goods until they
got to that part.</p>

<p><a name="png.061" id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
A damzel with reddish hair gowned in
trailing black satin and beads rose from a
couch with a nice smile saying “What, please?”
as Mr. Withersq told her. She then ran lightly
up a few ladders and threw boxes down
until he had chosen the kind of under things
he craved from amongst these. There were
garments of satin and silk and fleece all very
refined and nice but Mr. Withersq chose his
to be of peech pink as he thought that was
rather fashenable and odd.</p>

<p>He then gave orders for his name and £sd
in a little ring to be embroidered on all these
and paying her some good few pounds proceeded
to another apartment.</p>

<p>“Come Selia,” he cried, “we must quickly
make ourselves chick.”</p>

<p>And so with a harty slap on the back he led
her on towards the boot part of the shop.</p>

<p>“Show me some shoes and boots of the
best” cried he smiling fondly to the lady at the
<a name="png.062" id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>boots, “this is me and my young lady Selia,
we are to go in socierty and must dress the
part as you doubtless no.”</p>

<p>So he bought a yellow pair with butons and
a couple of black pairs of shoes and some
white hairy ones and some red house shoes,
and Selia had some shiny black shoes with
dimond buckles and some pale boots and some
openwork boots up the sides and some high
shiny boots and some fur boots for the bedroom
and satin slippers of every hugh besides
stockings to match and silk all the way up at
that every time and very nice to feel.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Withersq bought black coats
both day and night with plad trouwsers for
day and smooth black ones for nite and a sport
suit with whiskers on it that smelt, with top
hats fawn and black and a night hat that
popped up and down with a snap.</p>

<p>Selia then got</p>

<ul>
<li>Velvet hats</li>
<li><a name="png.063" id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Lace hats</li>
<li>Silk hats with stremers</li>
<li>Lether hats</li>
<li>Straw hats some with flowrs and fethers</li>
<li>Bed hats of frills and bows</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">and all of these had its own privet box to be in
and a lid that fitted it. While as to the robes
that her loving Harold streud on her no tongue
could tell for there was a high stepped lady
all to themselves that taurght them what to by
and for when which is the worst to know and
the things piled up like greased litning till all
the persons in the shop left their jobs and all
the people too and the boys that wizz the lifts
up and down too and all followed and stared
to see so rich a man prepar his fate. He
topped it all by ordering gloves by boxfuls, a
fan as curly as a ostrich and under attire by
wisper for his sweet, which she went into a
littel privet part to chose herself.</p>

<p>And they went out of that shop most
<a name="png.064" id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>exceeding grand dressed all in new things
scruffing their shoes on the floor to take the
shiny off, carrying parcels all eyes glaring
upon them and left boxes and boxes full to
come on by Carter Pattisen.</p>

<p>“Taxi, sir?” asked the sarjent-looking man
at the door bowing more low than at first.</p>

<p>“Yes” gruntled Mr. Withersq as the
strings of his parcels cut his fingers a bit and
he was sore tired.</p>

<p>A taxi swam up to the edge of the path and
the man opened the door of it and Selia nipped
in and sank down in its interiaw.</p>

<p>“Where to?” said the driver, which made
Mr. Withersq think twice before he spoke that
time.</p>

<p>Seeing his destress the sarjent-looking man
wispered in his ear as a sugestion: “why not
the Grand Palace my good sir, it is very
sentral.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Withersq got to the point at last
<a name="png.065" id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and ordered the taxi to go to the Grand
Palace, which he did.</p>

<p>When they got there Mr. Withersq
stumped into the hall as he had had an idear.</p>

<p>“Trot me out the boss!” he cried to the
trembling girl in the glass desk there and she
ran for him.</p>

<p>When he came he was fat and red.</p>

<p>“I am the manager” he utered.</p>

<p>“So?” said Mr. Withersq knowing well
that would make him feel small. “Well I am
Mr. Withersq, my unckle Burt has left me
many millions, I have my lady Selia with me,
I am the Head Poet of the Land and I wish
to rent your second and third floors all to myself
one for me and one for her, as only the
best will do for us.”</p>

<p>“You want two whole floors?” spat the red
manager.</p>

<p>“I do” said Mr. Withersq.</p>

<p>“But what of those who are within the

 </span></span></a>floors?” said the manager who was very afraid
by now.</p>

<p>“Tell them I will foot their bills” replyed
Mr. Withersq “and ask no questions if they
will get out.”</p>

<p>The red man turned pale now and ran away
to do Mr. Withersquashes bequest, and Mr. Withersq went to fech Selia and the band
struck up in the hall amongst the parms and
sweet flowers, and the girl in the glass desk
bowed and so the pair proudly entered and
went up the stares to their apartments, and
those who had been in the rooms before went
hurried down the back stairs, but it was
no trouble to them as they knew that they had
made on the bargen.</p>

<p>After they had gone to their two floors and
settled down and sent for all their close, Selia
called down the stairs to her Harold: “I say,
Squashy dear, lets go for a ride on a horse.”</p>

<p>“Why yes” said Mr. Withersq, “<!-- TN: opening quote invisible -->that is a
<a name="png.067" id="png.067" href="#png.067"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>very smart thing to do indeed, I wonder we
did not think of it before.”</p>

<p>So he rang the bell that was standing on a
little tabel very handy in the passage, and a
dear little boy with three rows of beady butons
all up his coat came tripping to reply to it.</p>

<p>“Go out and buy me some breeches”
ordered Mr. Withersq “my dear little lad.
And please get me two whips and a riding
skirt for the lady. Be quick back and you can
keep the change.”</p>

<p>And he handed him a bag full of money.</p>

<p>Off tripped the little lad and shortly returned
with boxes from a nabouring shop. He
had thoughtfully brought all that was the
thing, riding boots and hats and whips and
gloves for two, and a pair of breeches each,
shaggy ones for Mr. Withersq and black for
Selia with a coat and skirt in one also to cover
her up. They slipped into these things and
tossing the remains of the money to the boy
<a name="png.068" id="png.068" href="#png.068"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>they went out and hired two horses and went
for a ride in the park to get up an appetite for
tea after all they had eaten at the Majpottels.
It joggled them up a bit on the horses as all
they had ever rode before was at the fairs, still
they stuck it and were stout of heart.</p>

<p>Just as they were coming out of the Park
to go home a poleeceman stopt them.</p>

<p>“Are you by way of being Mr. Withersquash?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said our hero without quaking for
he knew he had done no rong, “what of it,
eh?”</p>

<p>“A messej has just come from the Palace
that his dear Magesty the King would like
you to slip in to tea and see him, as he wants
to see what sort of a new poet he has got.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” said Mr. Withersq, “will
it do if we go as we are, and do you think I
can take Selia too?”</p>

<p>“I expect it will be all right” said the
<a name="png.069" id="png.069" href="#png.069"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>poleeceman. “His Magesty is very kind and
nice, I dont think he would mind much.”</p>

<p>So they rode on their horses down to the
Palace, and tied the reins on to those twisty
rails in front of it, and the guards in the hairy
hats nodded to them, and they went into the
front yard and up to the door and then in,
as they knew they were expected.</p>

<p>Oh what an hour for Mr. Withersq and his
Selia to step at last on that envied spot.</p>

<p>“Littel did I think when we set out that we
should go so far nor do so well” uttered Mr. Withersq in a low tone from respect as they
went inside. Just then a junior admiral came
stepping smartly to meet them.</p>

<p>“Ha good day dear Mr. Withersq” said he
with a grin.</p>

<p>“Goodday indeed,” responded he. “Let me
interduce Selia. Shake hands Selia!” which
she did.</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you” said the admiral who
<a name="png.070" id="png.070" href="#png.070"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was garbed in serge and brade of purest gold.
He then went on “Perhaps you’d like to tidy
up a bit before you go in to tea?”</p>

<p>“If its not troubling you” said Selia, who
was a bit shattered in looks after the horse.</p>

<p>“Certainly not” said the admiral kindly
“we have a special place for that sort of thing.
When visiters come in on the hop as you have
they generally want a brush and washup by
the time they arrive.”</p>

<p>“Yes traveling does make one so fussely,
does not it” cried Selia in a boomy tone
which caused the admiral to open wide his
admiring eyes as he had no doubt thought she
would be quite common and was glad to find
it was not so after all.</p>

<p>“Quite, quite” agreed he, adding “and I
have sent to tell the guards at the gate to be
sure and give your horses some water and
straw for their tea so do not worry about
them.”</p>

<p><a name="png.071" id="png.071" href="#png.071"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Oh they are not ours thanks all the same”
said Mr. Withersq. “Still you might as well
have a drink sent out to them if you dont
mind, thanks.”</p>

<p>The admiral now led them to the place for
the toilett and passed them on to the persons
there. It was a very vast hall complete with
shaving chairs with shavers in silk jackets who
soon took Mr. Withersq and wrapped him up
in cloths and gave him a good scrape and Selia
in turn went to a marbel tabel where one
damsel tidyed her hair kindly and another
gave her pouder and all those kinds of things
and another polished her nails nicely with
pinka and wiped her boots over with a velvet
and when both were neat they returned to the
admiral who was waiting because that is what
he was for. So he looked them over and saw
there was no hares on Mr. Withersquashes
coat and everything as it should be.</p>

<p>On he led them down passage after passage
<a name="png.072" id="png.072" href="#png.072"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and through room after room, and he let them
have a peep in to where the best of the m.p.’s
were thinking out some new laws which interested
them both very much. And in the
next room they had a squint at a lot of generals
very fierce of mustashe who were practising
with swords and guns and keeping their
peckers up until the next war in that way because
if they dont they get livers and have to
retire.</p>

<p>And next to them in another room were the
sea lords, some of whom waved very friendly
to the conductor of our little party, but they
were not very busy at work as their time for
swimming practise was over for that day, and
they were having the half day off, so ideled the
time with marveleous jig-saws and draufts
and chesses and what not, very cosy in their
nice room.</p>

<p>At last they came to a very grand high
passage all lined with flags of conquered
<a name="png.073" id="png.073" href="#png.073"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>countries and a stuffed lion in a glass case on
the left just before a door, which was the door
of the room where the King and Queen were,
at which both Selia and Harold began to
tremble not a little, for of all things they
wanted to make a good impression.</p>

<p>“Have a heart” cried the admiral kindly,
“they will not eat you, and there is no fuss on
purpose not to make you feel small as the King
well nose that it is a bit queer for a poet like
you coming to see him in his Palace for the
first time.”</p>

<p>At that he gave a respecful tap on the door
and departed.</p>

<p>They entered meekly into a great room with
slippery floor, and in the centre there was a
tabel all heaped with flowers and set for about
ten and smothered in sweet foods, and at this
tabel sat the King and her dear Magesty the
Queen was just pouring out tea. They had
pushed back their thrones to seem more at
<a name="png.074" id="png.074" href="#png.074"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>home and sat on simpel chairs, and the
Princess and the Princes were alas not
there, so no doubt they were elsewhere on
business.</p>

<p>“I am Mr. Withersq” said our hero as he
went in, holding Selia by the hand and making
a courtly bow, “and this is my lady Selia.
We were out riding and only just knew you
wanted us so we came strait on.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right” said the King, getting up
to push two more chairs to the tabel for them.
“We’re very glad to see you. Excuse us having
started but we didn’t know if you’d get
here in time and we were dying for a cup of
tea.”</p>

<p>“Sit down, do,” said the Queen nicely,
because she guest they would not dare to sit
unless told.</p>

<p>Now Selia found her tongue and said
“It is so very good of you to let me come in
too, it will be a great help to me, and I have
<a name="png.075" id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>always so wanted to see you, little dreaming I
ever should when Ma and I used to go to the
pictures together and see you on the Pathe.”</p>

<p>“Really now?” said the Queen passing
down two more cups of tea for them, “very
pleased to see you I’m sure at last. What is
this they tell me about your young man’s having
done so well at poetry?”</p>

<p>So Selia told her all about how he came in
for a good bit of money and how they set out
to get on in the world, and how Emilyon
Boom had turned up his nose, and how Mr. Withersq had got the prize as best poet, and
how now if only she could make a hit too they
hoped shortly to wed. And the Queen
listened very nicely and promised that
Emilyon Boom should be punished and not
allowed to write poems any more. All this
time Selia was getting plenty to eat too.</p>

<p>Meantime the King and Mr. Withersq
were having a nice chat.</p>

<p><a name="png.076" id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>72<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Listen my dear” said the King to the
Queen, “my Head Poet is telling me that his
young lady wants to make a hit and she is
going to shew the world what she can do in
the way of sport. Now dont you think we
might go and see her, because that will be a
help if the people know we are going to be
there, wont it? And I have taken a great liking
to these young people, and should like to
see them happily married.”</p>

<p>“Certenly, certenly,” utered the Queen
most kindly patting Selia’s hand for a moment
so that was setled and after a bit they
got up to go and happily remembered to go
out through the door backwards and the King
waved his hand kindly as they did so to say
goodbye, but the Queen was busy ringing the
bell for a maid to clear.</p>

<p>“I hope he thought I was all right as a
poet” Mr. Withersq said outside, “I suppose
<a name="png.077" id="png.077" href="#png.077"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I shall often have to pop in and see him if he
keeps me on.”</p>

<p>Just then the King called “Hi!” from inside
the room so they peeked in again to see
what it was.</p>

<p>“Oh I say! I quite forgot your medel” he
said, laufing a good bit, “here you are then and
blessings on you.” It was a nice little medal
like tiny leaves in gold which is what the Head
Poet wears so as people know what he is
altho’ you dont often see him. So they again
bowed and waved goodbye and came out and
went back along all the passages and so out
into the yard and there the horses still were,
looking a bit fed up with waiting so long. And
as they strode up to them a very good thing
happened, because a photo man from the
newspapers came up and took their photos
which is fame indeed.</p>

<p>“What luck” cried Selia gayly as they rode
<a name="png.078" id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>74<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>away, “it was indeed a good idear to go to the
poetry school was it not! see how you have
got on!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we are getting on all right” he
replyed for of a truth he had learnt by now
that it is only the first step that hurts.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">When they got back to the hotel, a
goodly knot of persons were about
the entrance and dotted in the nobel
hall, and at our little heroes arrival their
chatter died to a respectful hiss, and bowing
nicely to right and left Harold Withersq and
his Selia stamped within, but Selia wished all
the to do was for her.</p>

<p>“Toodleoo” she told her Harold “I am to
get my nails done at a place.”</p>

<p>“Done?” snarled her sweet. “How done?”</p>

<p>“At much cost” said Selia simply so with a
delited smile he drew forth the copious
money and stuffed the notes in her bag which
was like a crocodil with head tail and paws but
it was only a little one and lined with stuff.
Then Mr. Withersq waved her away so she
<a name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>departed getting a bit mixed up in the roundabout
at the door which is only meant for fun
but she got jamd.</p>

<p>“Now gentlemen” said he stripping off his
new butter coloured gloves like banana skins
as he had seen heros do on the pictures, “and
what may I do for you.” This he had learnt
in shops in the old days so it was not very
smart.</p>

<p>Now these new folk, most men in servicable
suits and white collars wearing nose-glasses
before their keen eyes but a few ladys in prim
attire, stepped up and they were all from
newspapers, for the fame of Harold Withersq
had spread and he was the talk of the hour.
So that the newspapers had snapt at the
chance of a bit from him.</p>

<p>As the babbel ceased Mr. Withersq made
a motion of modesty and sought to retire, but
was cort short by a ruddy one in checks who
asked him would he write a little for his paper,
<a name="png.081" id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and another thin one who asked him when he
was born, and a lady who commanded him to
tell her about love for the ladys page.</p>

<p>All agog Mr. Withersq who was never one
to lose a chance, made to tell them, knowing
no guile, when a sudden thought smote him,
he clasped his brow rather earnest for a
moment, then brushing them from him,
he darted into the glassy telephone box near
by.</p>

<p>“Hello” cried he to the invisible voice of
the girl of the wires, “get me the editer of the
<cite>Daily Pull</cite>” and so stood waiting for it.</p>

<p>The assembled crowd breathed in distress
for this was a bold move. The girl got Mr. Withersq on after he had stamped a little
because of being hot in the glassy box and he
sweated so much.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Withersq” he was heard to
utter. All were aghast to think he dared to
summons that great editor to the phone. The
<a name="png.082" id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>voice of our hero continued very proud for
who was he to bend before editors now:</p>

<p>“You have heard of me. My unckle Burt
having died leaving the goods, you know how
I stept into glory, and how I am in society and
I have become the Head Poet. Some folks
have come to tap my brains for their papers,
so I thought I would ring you up instead and
proffer to make you a chatty little bit for the
front page about how I got on in the world.”</p>

<p>“Very good then” he chortled in response
to the editors unheard words, “yes indeed it
is too true that all are willing to be told how to
get there but few arrive. I will do my best
by the public.” Cramming down the hear-piece
he burst from the box and ambled up to
his apartment humming a little air and leaving
the crushed crowd below.</p>

<p>Did he falter? That no one shall know but
he soon picked up, and tucked up his new
mauve cuffs, and sat down, and began.</p>

<p><a name="png.083" id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
And when Selia returned, she tripped into
his room where he sat now in a bandana
dressing-gown at a desk with a pen in hand
and some ink on his nose.</p>

<p>“Behold” cried she stripping her gloves and
twinkling like jewls her new-polished nails at
him, “lo Harold what they have done for me!”</p>

<p>“Tush” cried he blotting his last page, yet
looked towards her for he dearly loved her did
Mr. Withersq and had all of a great man’s
easy ways. “Quite a little picture” he went on
giving her a good look over. She was indeed
improved in a gown with red bits on and
slippery shoes very long and nasty-looking but
the thing and silk stocking of the best with
ventilations on the sides and the crocodil bag
and one of those little hats like a hen, which
when she took off laid bare a delicous mass of
curly hares and her face was made up suitable
to a lady. Selia was indeed grand.</p>

<p>“Kiss me then” said Harold to be done with
<a name="png.084" id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it, during which she wetted a new handky and
rubbed the ink off his nose.</p>

<p>“If I may say so you are rather smart to
look at now” he said, “I think that you will be
a credit to me and no doubt your time will
come.”</p>

<p>“Ah that it might” lisped she sorely with a
tear, “for of a truth the ladys are none to nice
to me when you are absent and I have many a
bitter stair with that sideways turn of the head
which is so proud from some no better than
me but safely married. Or so I take it.”</p>

<p>“Shush shush” cried the kind Mr. Withersq. “All will be well, and I will marry
you so soon as I can afford to do so without
putting my foot in the social hole. And in
the meantime I am writing newspapers.”</p>

<p>Selia now clapped her hands none knowing
better than she to what heits the newspapers
can carry some who know how to take bulls
by the horns, and then feeling a bit out of it
<a name="png.085" id="png.085" href="#png.085"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as she noticed him casting an eye on the inkpot
once more, crept from the room and went up
to her bedroom to have a nap under the quilt,
and dream of the rosy days yet to come.</p>

<p>When she woke again it was morning for
she had been sore tired by all the events and
had slept round the clock twice. Beneath her
lace-veiled window the voice of many newsboys
cried a name she seemed to know, so
slipping from her bed she flew to have a peep
into the street, and hanging well out she saw
oh with what glee and pride writ large on every
plachard held before the stomaches of the
newsboys these words:</p>

<p class="ctr">HOW I DID IT:<br
 />By <span class="smc">H. Withersquash</span><br
 />(Head Poet)</p>

<p>Now was Selia indeed moved to pride, and
wept a tear into the window-sill to think how
dearly she loved him and how high she had to
<a name="png.086" id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>rise yet before worthy to sit beside him as wife
and matron. So she crossed her little fingers
and wished hard that she might soon get a
good leg up through her good friends the
Majpottels, after which she slided out of her
clothes and things and had a nice wash in the
basin all over altho not knowing that such is
corect nature taught her it was best so every
day. And while doing up her hair she practiced
talking in the new voice and warking
with ease in the new thin shoes, and so with
a last dab of powder from a pretty little glass
pot on her dress-table, she popped downt to
breakfast very spry and determined to win.</p>

<p>And throughout London newsboys shouted
the fame of Mr. Withersquash.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Mr. Withersq was already digging at
the last of his second egg with rather
a cross face, as he really preferred
duck’s eggs as being more sustaining, when
she entered their private eating apartment at
whose door stood a chef sent to watch over
their food by the hotel manager.</p>

<p>“Hello dearie” cried he rising and casting
the gloom off his face, as he had learnt to rise
for ladys by now. “We have a treat in store
for to-day.” And he nodded to the chef to
bring Selia her breakfast, which the good man
with his white hat did and then retired out of
the room.</p>

<p>“Oh Harold what is it?” she cried settling
her new brown gown, “is it a better kind of
party?”</p>

<p><a name="png.088" id="png.088" href="#png.088"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>84<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Well hardly” said Mr. Withersq resuming
his egg, “it is to go to a trial.”</p>

<p>“Oh! How delishus” said Selia in glee, “is
it a murder?”</p>

<p>“No” said Mr. Withersq, “it is much
better, it is a divorce, murders being a little
vulgar. But the very cream go to divorces,
and were it not for my having this morning
before you rose purchaced a good half of the
<cite>Daily Pull</cite> and put the editor in my pocket I
do not think even we should have got in.”</p>

<p>“Oh so now you have a newspaper” chirped
his love.</p>

<p>“Yes” said Mr. Withersq hortily “and as it
is we have seats in the front.”</p>

<p>Truly pleased by this thoughtful and
lucky idea Selia fell to and despatched her
food after which they stepped into a taxi and
rode to the law court.</p>

<p>It was a dark forboding place somewhat
square. A crowd of poor jostled without.
<a name="png.089" id="png.089" href="#png.089"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The photos of Selia and her Harold were
taken as they left the taxi to enter, at which
Selia bridled a little but not her Harold. For
a flash he feared they were mistaken for the
guilty partys but it was not so only his fame.</p>

<p>Inside was a great dark hall like church
and the ten comandments in frames at the
top, between which sat a juge in scarlet and
ermin with a white wig, who was on a carved
chair, with lawyers on one side in a row and
jurys on the other in a pew and the lawyers
were all lean and busy with papers, but the
jurys were all plump and did nothing but sit.</p>

<p>A stir occurred as our heroes entered and
were led by a beadel to the front row at which
the judge beat his little hammer on the desk
of his throne and cried “Ordre” very stern for
all present were twisting and craning to get a
better view of our pair, more so the ladys of
whom there were many with lunsheon baskets
seated around.</p>

“This is not a school of poetry,” said the
judge aside and drew a laugh, so Mr. Withersq
knew at once this must be the famous Judge
Crop the well-known wit. So they both sat
down and settled.</p>

<p>The buss died down and silence came as a
door at the side opened and amid a murmur
of pity the partys to the divorce were led in,
pale-faced and dismally clanking the handcuffs
on their wrists, and the injured husband
led the way. There were three in all, the lady
and the villian with meek look following after,
and the lady was very soberly dressed in
black coat and skirt as befitted her position.</p>

<p>A policeman led them to stand in a row
before the Judge, and they all three stood mum
while the lawyers began to rise one by one and
muter and muter and rasple their papers, and
bow now and then to the Judge who seemed
to sleep nevertheless he opened an eye from
time to time.</p>

Selia was a bit vexed for she found it dull
and it was very hot, and they were so squashed,
so she laid back a good bit against her Harold,
and attemted to list.</p>

<p>“Ha” cried the Judge suddenly waking,
“and what have you to say for yourself” as he
glared at the villian, so the Wife fell to sobbing,
and all the audience were greatly moved.
But poor Selia was so sleepy with stuffiness
that she dropped off without hearing more
and only woke in time to hear the worst. The
Villian and Wife had exprest their regrets,
the jurys had talked the matter over, and the
Judge was sitting on them, with a black cap
on his head.</p>

<p>In slow and solemn words he drorled forth
his mind and the end of it all was that he condemned
the Wife and the Villian both to
prison for six months to learn to mend their
ways, at which the Husband rubbed hands of
glee and the wicked Wife and the terrible
<a name="png.092" id="png.092" href="#png.092"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>88<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Villian trailed out to their sad fate, at which
the meeting broke up, and some were
heard to say it had not been much fun. But
Harold said it was a good show, as the Judge
had made four jokes. So they pushed out
through the throng to the taxi still waiting
and poured quietly back home as Harold was
to write some more that day about how to make
a splash in socierty for the front page of his
newspaper.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">He departed to his room as soon as they
entered and left Selia to herself so she
sat on her bed and was bored. Sweet
was the sound of the lunch-bell, but she did
not speak to Mr. Withersq during the meal
as she was cross, and he did not either because
he was thinking.</p>

<p>Lunch over he called her again to his
side.</p>

<p>“Alas, alas how fondly I love your charms”
he said in his usual softly mode.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you do and perhaps you dont”
snarled she making herself very stiff as he
tried to press her to him. “All the same it
would look better if you paid more notice to
me instead of to making yourself so grand
<a name="png.094" id="png.094" href="#png.094"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with writing newspapers, knowing very well
you ought to be writing poems, and vexing
the King no doubt, as he must have made you
Head Poet for something. Unless you find
me no more than a drag on you as a humbel
girl and wish me to go back to ma.”</p>

<p>At this he first brushed cobwebs from his
brow in amaze for he had not looked at it from
this side, and then laughing much for he was
no ill-temperd boor was Withersq, he drew
her very loving to his knee and soothed her
with strokes, and once more promised all
should be well and that the Majpottels had her
case in hand and would know when to
strike.</p>

<p>“Oh dont tell me” she said but nestling a
little so as not to be-anger him, “the Majpottels
are coming for me at three.”</p>

<p>“Coming?” snapped he. “And why may I
ask?”</p>

<p>“Ah that is a secret” she said archly, feeling
<a name="png.095" id="png.095" href="#png.095"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>91<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>now she had got her own back and she coyly
rubbed his ears over till they were redder than
ever.</p>

<p>“Remember. You are mine” he urged
rather stern for his was a true love. “I trust
you.”</p>

<p>“Not half” responded she, and changed the
subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Withersq now popped her on the floor
and got up, feeling for his gloves and hat, as
he had got quite used to nice ways now.</p>

<p>“Come sweet” he cried, having found them
on a green silk sofa under the window. “I
have something to show you.”</p>

<p>So he led her down the red-carpet stairs
towards the hotel door, and the uniform man
worked the whirling doors for them very
humbly.</p>

<p>“Lo” he cried.</p>

<p>Oh what a treat for Selia! Drawn up to
the footwark what should be there but a motor
<a name="png.096" id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>car painted blue with a blue-coat man to drive
it and on the door was painted £sd just as
Mr. Withersq had had put on all his underlinen.</p>

<p>“It is for us” said he proudly, so they
stepped in, the man snapt the door to, and
drove to the park.</p>

<p>Hardly had they arrived there when a very
nice thing occurred for as they glided along
the smooth path between the trees, looking
very chic and bored, who should they meet
but the Countess who had been at the party
the first night they burst upon a startled
world. So they drew up. The countess who
was in a thin white car and working it herself
stopped too seeming to know them, and so
they had a little chat.</p>

<p>“Goodmorning I am the Countess, perhaps
you dont recollect me” said she, without
smiling or letting the stiff look off her face.
Selia who had been about to give a grin
stopped herself just in time and continued to
<a name="png.097" id="png.097" href="#png.097"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>93<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>have the bored look, which she now knew was
the thing when meeting a pal.</p>

<p>“Indeed yes” she said very slow as tho’ too
tired, yet in her heart determined to push forward
now or never, “you were <em>so</em> kind to us.”</p>

<p>“Oh dont pray mention it” the smart lady
replyed with a well-trained smile, “only too
pleased and if you would care to come and
have tea with me to-morrow I shall be very
delited. I dont think my husband will
mind.”</p>

<p>“Certainly we will and thank you” said Mr. Withersq, as though he had not heard that
last bit.</p>

<p>“Is that your dog?” inquired Selia, wishing
to chat on for she liked to be beheld chatting
in the Park, more so with a Countess.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is Lipstick my poodle” the
beauty said yawning, but it wasn’t realy a
poodle, rather more like a white dashund with
rough hare and very polished eyes.</p>

<p>“How sweet he is” lisped Selia.</p>

<p><a name="png.098" id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>94<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Is not he?” replyed their new friend “and
how charming your new car is!”</p>

<p>“Yes” said Selia “it is not so bad,” and her
heart gave a secret bound with pride, “well
we must toddle now. Gooby.”</p>

<p>“Gooby” replyed the Countess and pulled
a thing and so moved away, leaving them very
pleased with how they were getting on.</p>

<p>When they had gone all along the gravel
path, and across the bridge by the Serpentine
and up to Bayswater, and then back, having
successfully caused a few horses with riders
on them to dance on their back legs, which is
why many folks go in motors in the Park, as
this is a sort of sport, Selia spoke again.</p>

<p>“It is a very nice car indeed” she said a
little in confusion, “and runs smooth as butter.
But now I must be getting back dear Harold.”</p>

<p>Scowling on her, Mr. Withersq poked his
head out of the side door and told the man to
go back to the hotel, which he did, making
<a name="png.099" id="png.099" href="#png.099"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>95<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that popping noise all down Piccadilly, and
when they got to the door Mr. Withersq
got out, helped Selia down, raised his hat and
waited for her to depart within the hotel.</p>

<p>Dearly wishing to teaze his male curiossity
she lingered a little until stung into madness
by her mystery he said very stern.</p>

<p>“Do not trifle with a good man’s affections.”</p>

<p>“Ho!” quoth she, “trifle? Indeed I do not
trifle but do my bit as well as may be so that
all should end well. And if you had asked me
why I retire I would have told you but now
wild horses should not make me speak because
of your bad heart.”</p>

<p>With a careless laugh she plunged in
through the doors and was immediately fallen
upon by the Majpottels who had on their pink
and blue shirts, with pale grey suits and straw
hats in hand, beaming with long sad smiles
into her face, and so between them they walked
the length of the hall and back, chatting (this
<a name="png.100" id="png.100" href="#png.100"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was to exercise Selia in the art of social ease)
and then sat awhile in green-painted basket
chairs near the parms. Now it was a very hot
day and both of the brothers were reddish and
rather damp, but noblesse obliged them not to
mop their heads and necks as this is low.</p>

<p>“What will you drink” uttered Gerald
politely to Selia.</p>

<p>“What is smart?” asked she very low.</p>

<p>“Oh you had better have a coktale” replyed
he “as that is all ladys drink just at present,”
and so he ordered one, but Selia made a
mistake and let the cherry at the bottom of the
little tubby glass into her mouth and so had
to put the stone out. Rupert frowned on her
a little for this, and she saw that the elegant
brothers had left their cherry alone uneaten.
She made note of this for the future.</p>

<p>“You’ll be wanting to change wont you”
now wispered Gerald, who was looking rather
lively. Selia took the hint and went up to her
<a name="png.101" id="png.101" href="#png.101"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>97<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>apartment, not knowing in deuce what she
should wear out of the many attires concealed
within the drawers there.</p>

<p>To her surprise, as she entered the room, a
small squabby woman in black with black
velvet and some white frills in her hair rose
from a seat by the window.</p>

<p>“I am Madames new maid” this person
said with a nice bow of respect, “my name is
Scrogg. What would Madame like to wear.”</p>

<p>This vision so took away our herione’s
breath that she hardly new what to say for a
moment, then laughing to herself as she guest
what it was, and thought of all that it meant to
be a rich man’s pet, she turned coldly aside
and wispered something to the new maid who
went at once to the proper draw and drew
forth what was needful.</p>

<p>Selia was a modest girl and had not been
used to undressing before folks, but knew that
it had to be done and summoning her
<a name="png.102" id="png.102" href="#png.102"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>strength she gave herself up to be divested of
her attire, and arrayed anew in purest white
suitable for her secret errand.</p>

<p>“A more simpel mode for the hair?” suggested
Scrogg who was very nifty. Selia
nodded as she guest this was better.</p>

<p>Fresh as paint and smelling a little of something
Scrogg had sprinkled at her on leaving,
Selia descended once more to the waiting
Majpottels who sat each with chin on stick,
leaving Scrogg to tidy away which is what a
maid largely is for and saves a heap of time.</p>

<p>In her heart Selia was not quite sure
whether Scrogg was an offspring of the
Majpottels minds or whether a pretty attention
of her dear Harolds so she said nothing.
And as a matter of fact it was Gerald who had
done it, knowing she needed a woman’s care,
and he had got Scrogg at great cost from a
Lord, for he too in his way was one to stick at
nothing.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">It was quite late in fact it was almost eight
when Selia came back and tho she knew
she had done no wrong she felt a little sly
as she quickly slipped up the hotel stares,
gazed on by the usual knot of folk who hung
around to get a peep of her and Harold in the
hotel lounge. She panted into the eating
apartment. No one. So she popped up into
her room where Scrogg sat eating a sandwich,
and got off her white which was now
dashed, and Scrogg fluffed her hair out
archly, and put her into a evening gown,
making her tuck her vest straps under her
arms and expose a great deal too much or so
she felt but Scrogg said no it had to be so.
Scrogg then told her one or two things which
<a name="png.104" id="png.104" href="#png.104"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>opened her eyes. But she affected to hear
nothing altho really it soaked in.</p>

<p>After a gaze in the mirror which pleased her
as she looked quite like a lady by now with
waved hair and a sleek traily gown of black
with lace streamers hanging, and all her neck
and front and half her back bare, she sailed
from the room as Scrogg told her a rather diffrent
walk is needed in the evening much
more snake-like. Entering once more the
eating-apartment, she found the white-hatted
chef alone, altho’ the table was set.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Withersq” said she.</p>

<p>“I am afraid he is not well” the chief replied
“he entered a little while ago, with pale look,
and went away again.”</p>

<p>Like a hen robbed of her young Selia
darted to the room of her Harold. There
spread on the imense wooden bed with four
posts, lay her devestated Harold, and the
blinds were down.</p>

<p><a name="png.105" id="png.105" href="#png.105"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
Tiptoeing in “What is it, what is it” she
cried, “Have you written too much?”</p>

<p>“It is not that,” came the mournful voice of
our hero from the bed, “it is worse. I am a
ruined man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Harold!” gasped the distracted Selia
in dismay.</p>

<p>A great groan burst from his brest. Together
they sobbed a while.</p>

<p>“Come” said Selia at last “I command you
tell me what it is. Are you married in secret?”</p>

<p>“No, not so bad as that perhaps, because it
can be cured.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to prison? Are you mad?”</p>

<p>“No, no” sniveled the wretched man. “I
cant tell you.”</p>

<p>“Dont say the money has gone!”</p>

<p>“Ah no” cried he of a sudden sitting up at
the mere idear, “ah no! I think we shall yet
win, but it is a bad mess I am in.”</p>

<p>And so he sobbed out his sad story.</p>

During the while she had been away that
day who should Harold meet but the head
poet of the limerick class from the school of
poetry and they had been to have a quick one
together. Falling into talk as men will they
had begun to exchange the latest tales, some
not too nice, and indeed most of what Harold
had brought with him from the lower world
but he thought that the limerick poet would
not mind as poets always like low life. He
had told him a couple of good ones, and as it
happened they were both about sport.</p>

<p>“I thought something was up” moaned the
unhappy man, “for he gave me a very funny
look. And as we were to come out, as we
stood with our toothpicks on the step, he made
a fishy excuse to pop off for a minute. When
he came back he said there was a man he
would like me to meet, so we went in the new
car. It was a house out of Oxford St., which
I thought strange, still as I was having a sigar
<a name="png.107" id="png.107" href="#png.107"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I thought perhaps it was that made me a bit
nervy. Imagine my woe when we entered and
I then found myself alone and defenseless
with ... what do you think?”</p>

<p>“Lie down dear Harold and dont get
excited” Selia said altho she was all agogg
herself. “What was it? Cardsharpers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no” sighed he, “it was the smell that
told me almost before I was within, like floor-polish
and cough-drops mixed and a bit of gin
thrown in for sport. No, it was a doctors, one
of the costly kind with carpets on the floor and
carving instruments in glass cases.”</p>

<p>“A doctor!” screamed Selia. “Have you
then an ilness?” And she rapidly mopped
odor cologne on to his brow cuasing him to
sneze which eased him.</p>

<p>“Well it is a kind of ilness but very odd and
you will not catch it” he said. “And I think it
was a trick tho’ meant well by the limerick-poet
as you will see.”</p>

<p><a name="png.108" id="png.108" href="#png.108"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>104<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“How so?” said Selia very bold for she
would have tore his enemys in half.</p>

<p>“Well to cut a long story short, I have got
a kind of hidden passion which is nawing at
my heart, and that is why I cannot write any
more poems.”</p>

<p>“What did the Doctor do to you” urged
she eager to get to the point and hear the
worst, “did he operate?”</p>

<p>“No he was very kind” said Harold
propping himself up a bit against his pillows
“and it took me a long while to get the hang
of it all. He told me I have been under a
strane and feared I was ill and wished to ask
me a few questions. Said he leaning back and
making cats cradles on his pink fingers,
“<!-- TN: opening quote invisible, note outer quote continues over several paragraphs -->have
you anything on your mind?”</p>

<p>So of course says I, “No.”</p>

<p>At that he shot me a serpentine glance.</p>

<p>“Now my good man” said he “just let your
mind ease out and answer me at random.”</p>

<p><a name="png.109" id="png.109" href="#png.109"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“<!-- TN: opening quote invisible -->As I was feeling a bit mad I thought it best
to humor him as I feared otherwise I might
give him a smartish tap for you know what I
am when roused.”</p>

<p>“Bat” said he to me, simple like.</p>

<p>“Ball” said I to humour him.</p>

<p>“Out” says he cunning.</p>

<p>“Over” says I to catch him, and this got
him for a moment. Then he dartled to a little
exercise book and made a mark in it on some
squares, and rang his bell at which a seceretary
came in, and mutered with her, till she
went out. A nice girl in a white blouse too.”</p>

<p>“Ha” said Selia as tho’ stung. “But what
were they at.”</p>

<p>“Well dearest you see it is a new disease.
The doctors being hard up between you and
me and the gatepost because the herd are not
dying off so much as they did.”</p>

<p>“No I’ve noticed that, there’s hardly ever
a nice funeral nowadays,” said Selia.</p>

<p><a name="png.110" id="png.110" href="#png.110"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Well and what with that and having no
more apendicles to cut out they had to be at
something fresh,” he continued.</p>

<p>“I see” said Selia who as will have been
noticed had growed almost meek in these latter
days and sat merely stroking her Harolds
hand in pity.</p>

<p>“So now they declare in their bold way that
all clever folk have a brane sickness on the
lines of a drain stoppage (if you will excuse
me) and he was artful-like pumping me to try
and find out what had stopped the drain.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” With a yell Selia lept from the bed.</p>

<p>“Calm yourself Selia” said her Harold, preparing
to rise from his couch, “for you know
what bad form it is to show emoshun. And
all these adventers of mine are very smart indeed.”</p>

<p>“Smart? How smart?” snapt she quivering
with distres partly from the snub she had had.</p>

<p>“Sit down dear Selia” he said with a cool
<a name="png.111" id="png.111" href="#png.111"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>drorl, “and I will tell you how for you know
we must let nothing get past us even if it is
only a sickness.”</p>

<p>“Too true” she said subsidising somewhat
and becoming seated though at a distance.</p>

<p>“Well I think this must be very like the
latest craze of all” he said passing his hand
over his brow and settling again on the bed,
“though come too soon in my career as it is
more fitted to those who are played out
whereas I am only at the post as you might
say and in my first flush. Still there is no
saying but it <em>is</em> smart.”</p>

<p>So Selia came and sat again on the bed’s
side while her love got it off his chest which is
always a good thing even in high life.</p>

<p>“Well this old meddiko kept on at me and
on and on and I began to get sleepy because
it was hot and there was a blue-bottel buzzing.
I do not know what I said but he was very interested.
Suddenly he sprang up. ‘Eureka’
<a name="png.112" id="png.112" href="#png.112"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>108<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he cried, and began pacing up and down and
down and up till I went quite swimmy. So
then it all came out.”</p>

<p>“And what was it” inquired Selia all agag.</p>

<p>“It was cricket.”</p>

<p>“What was?”</p>

<p>“My sickness.”</p>

<p>“How so? You were sick with cricket.
What cricket? Come do not play any tosh
with me.”</p>

<p>“It is no tosh” said Harold simpering a
little with pride. “I am the first case. Of
course between you and me it is somewhat
tosh. Still they are writing a article on me
called ‘Sport and Poetry: a Sycoanalsis of
Genius’ to prove that I am suffering from a
sort of squashed wish to play cricket just as
Shakespere suffered because his wish to play
tennis was squashed as he had not got the
price.”</p>

<p><a name="png.113" id="png.113" href="#png.113"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>109<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Oh I see” said Selia which she now knew
whas a useful thing to say.</p>

<p>“Dont interrupt” said he giving himself
one or two airs “it is all due to the squashed
wish. It is quite true I have said to myself
lately that now the summer is come it is a pity
I am a rich man because I cannot now very
well play with the boys as I did, and I dreamt
a bit about the good old times, and thought of
the ball I left in a box under my bed. Still,
that was all it was and we ought to be glad it
was no worse for it seems some men suffer
from squashed wishes of a kind it would little
befit me to tell you of.”</p>

<p>“Go on” said she “I’ve got you now. I read
of it in the Sunday papers.”</p>

<p>“Indeed” quoth he “I did not know you
were so advansed. It all goes to show how
truly I chose you for mine own dearest
Selia.”</p>

<p><a name="png.114" id="png.114" href="#png.114"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>110<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Hity tity” quoth she somewhat nettled,
“not so much stiffness even if you have a
squashed wish. You need not be so uppish
towards me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed must I” corrected he “for if we are
not stiff in private we may make a slip before
the world, and that will do no one any good,
will it?”</p>

<p>Springing from the bed now, he went to the
mirror and administered a little patting to his
attire to settle himself after being couched,
then pressing a kiss on the nape of his dear, he
prepared to lead her from the room.</p>

<p>“Come, fair” said he, this he had overheard
at the first party and kept for use “we have
lobster for dinner, so let’s make a hop.”</p>

<p>They entered the dining-apartment where
the chef had patiently waited keeping the
lobster on ice till needed, and they sat down
and tucked in, pondering within a while the
new sickness of Harold.</p>

<p><a name="png.115" id="png.115" href="#png.115"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>111<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“And is your squashed wish cured now?”
said she at last, wondering what form it might
take.</p>

<p>“Yes thank you it is greatly better, for it
is only a matter of letting the back come to the
front as in telling the doctor of it, and then all
is eased.”</p>

<p>“I see” said she “and I am glad you will not
play cricket for of a truth I think it is a little
common.”</p>

<p>And as they had now finished they wiped
their mouths, and he helped her rise, and they
went by their blue car to the opera where Mr. Withersq had retained a box.</p>

<p>The opera of course was already on, and as
they were both more than a little tired and
could not chatter as much as the fashion required
Mr. Withersq hired a small gramafone
from the box office which they plaiced on the
ground between their two gold chairs in their
regal box which was trimmed with red plush,
<a name="png.116" id="png.116" href="#png.116"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>112<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and this they put on from time to time in the
dull parts, which drew much attention as it
could be quite clearly heard all over the
theater, during the softer parts of the music,
which is the idea and much simpler than having
to keep on jawing. Because it is not
smart to sit silent at the opera.</p>

<p>And when the hero had killed the heroine
and sang a long song over her corpse, they got
up and went out and the crowd clapped a good
bit to see them go. And so they went home to
bed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The next morning Scrogg brought
Selia her morning tea and told her it
would be best to have a bath.</p>

<p>“They are made very pleasant now Madam”
she explained, as she threw all Selias close into
the tall basket behind the washstand, “what
with bath salts and animal sponges.” Selia in
surprise propped herself on elbow in the
couchy bed saying “Do they then have a bath
every day with clean underwear,” for even she
knew it was no good to put dirty close on a
clean body.</p>

<p>“Indeed yes” said Scrogg with a kind
smile. “My last lady was very particular, she
would never dream to have her bath without
her special frog sponge, so I made bold to buy
you one yesterday in the form of a pijeon
<a name="png.118" id="png.118" href="#png.118"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>114<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which you will find in its place in the bath
racket.”</p>

<p>“Ho” said Selia “I thought such things
were only for the young.”</p>

<p>“Dear no” said Scrogg departing with the
towels, “all things are animal now including
electric lights.”</p>

<p>And so Selia had a bath first however recalling
Scrogg.</p>

<p>“Go and tell Mr. Withersq to have a bath
every day too” she thoughtfully said “for I
fear he is not quite up to that yet.”</p>

<p>“Very good Madam” said Scrogg and went,
and so Selia tripped into the bathroom and
soaped well all over with the sponge which was
like a pijeon with a beak and wool eyes and
when she had had a good swill and a brisk dry
she felt so strong she ran out and banged all
the doors all down one side of the corridor for
as will be remembered she occupied a whole
floor to herself.</p>

<p><a name="png.119" id="png.119" href="#png.119"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>115<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
And after a good breakfast with her
Harold both of them reading Harold’s own
newspaper propped up on the toast-machine,
she departed on a mysterous errand to the
Majpottels whereat Mr. Withersq made a
sorry face, still as he was really very busy in
the mornings he didnt mind as much as he
looked, and set himself to writing his newspaper,
which he now did every day as he
thought it a good sport to tell others how to
get on, and smiled up his sleeve to think how
few would have Unckle Burts at the send-off,
still it was a good wheeze as long as the craze
for him lasted and made more money than
ever. He was a little bored with it already
however, for all though of low birth Mr. Withersq like all the truly great bored easily.
And from time to time he caught himself
thinking of cricket but not so much as he had
done as the doctor had already given him some
unthinking medesine, and each time he did
<a name="png.120" id="png.120" href="#png.120"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>116<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>think he wrote a poem and they were soon to
be printed in a book.</p>

<p>At about three Selia came tripping back a
bit red in the face and rather secret, and burst
into Mr. Withersq room where he was eating
a orange, with a noisy kiss.</p>

<p>“Huzzah” cried she “I think I shall yet
beat the band. But what are those smutty
objects near your ears?”</p>

<p>“Those are my new side-whiskers” replied
her Harold unctuously “for all poets have
them.”</p>

<p>“You dog” she said “you are cutting a
figure these days arent you?” And with these
words she rushed away to Scrogg to be attired.</p>

<p>At four she was ready in a slippery creation
of black with no arms to it but it was not an
evening dress, and a nose veil bedangling from
a ravished shapoo woven of the hares of horses.</p>

<p>“Let us sally” said she, gazing at him and
he gazed at her with pride for she looked very
much better.</p>

<p><a name="png.121" id="png.121" href="#png.121"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>117<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“You are a treat” he said gallantly so they
went down thro’ the hall which was worse
than ever with a dense crowd more staring
than ever to behold them, and out into their
blue car en route for the Countess tea.</p>

<p>When they got there it was a little house
but smart done up in black and white paint
with orange stuff for curtains, and lobellia in
boxes round the windows and two marbel
statues of little boys before the door, and they
both had curly hair.</p>

<p>The chauffeur rang the bell. How different
it was to when both had been poor. They felt
it. They strode within into a hall with bead
curtains and thro’ to a room at whose door
stood the Countess herself with welcoming
hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Withersq had a bit of trouble to get his
hat off in time.</p>

<p>“Ah good afternoon, how sweet of you to
come” cried their hostess.</p>

<p>“Not at all” Selia said “we were only too
<a name="png.122" id="png.122" href="#png.122"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>118<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pleased to visit you.” And they went into the
room. There was a lot of folks there eating off
plates in their laps and all murmured and
gazed to see the heroes of the hour enter, so
Selia and Mr. Withersq sat down and had
some plates passed to them and stretched out
for what food they could find lying about.</p>

<p>Near by Mr. Withersq sat a youngish lady
with plentiful ginger hair and robed in violet
with out-shooting lips and an ernest apperence.</p>

<p>“Do tell me” she burbled in a rich voice
“how you write such beautiful poems?”</p>

<p>But Mr. Withersq who had just tucked a
cress sandwich in his mouth could not say
much only growling in reply at which no one
seemed cross but all present cooed and
moaned, saying “Ah how simple he is” and
“How true” for it was very much like the
first party and “How true” was still the
<a name="png.123" id="png.123" href="#png.123"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>119<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fashion, like red hats sometimes appear and
are worn awhile and then drop out.</p>

<p>“He had poetry in him all the while” said
Selia “but it did not come out.”</p>

<p>So now the Countess came to sit beside her,
and pawed at her hand in love.</p>

<p>“Do you think the great man would come
to my little riverside home one day” uttered
she, “do please dear lady beg darling Mr. Withersq to come down to my little party at
Maidenhead next week. There will not be
much to entertain in fact we have only got two
funny people coming at present but we have
an excellent gramafone and perhaps the boats
would give him some new idears.”</p>

<p>All listened. Many of the ladys were
chewing on strings of coloured beads hung
about their necks and their ears waved for the
answer.</p>

<p>“Have you got any Harry Lauders” said
<a name="png.124" id="png.124" href="#png.124"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Selia for fun “for he is very partial to them.”
Her Harold was making warning faces to her
but she would not heed. Oh what an error.
You could hear the brick drop. But the
Countess had tact to give a little snickering
laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh I dont think he needs such low things”
said she, “you do not understand. No we have
only classical music. Nevertheless we should
be very glad to see him as I have rather a reputation
for my parties in fact I never have any
but the pick of socierty in my presence and I
should like to add dear Mr. Withersq to my
list.”</p>

<p>“Thank you” said Mr. Withersq not quite
seeing why she so had her knife in his love
“we will come.”</p>

<p>Selia sat biting a cake to show she did not
care.</p>

<p>Most of the guests who were numerous but
all ladys had put their cups down and now
<a name="png.125" id="png.125" href="#png.125"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were figetting about talking and poking into
all the Countesses things fingering the curtains
and picking up the ornaments to see if
the price was still on the bottom, tapping her
bits of furniture which were all a bit old-looking
but curious and not so bad for those
who are too proud to have new objects. Selia
thought this very rude and sat stiff in despare
finding the way to success very thorny for
women as not much notice came her way, as
when they were not poking about at the things
in the room they were fusseling round Mr. Withersq who sat with a silly smile on his face
to be the center of attraction.</p>

<p>But as good luck would have it Selia got her
own back for as she was a good bit bored she
got up and said Gooby. Now it is very smart
to be the first to go as it shows you do not
think much of where you are, so this was a
snub and had its effect for the ladys left
<a name="png.126" id="png.126" href="#png.126"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>122<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Mr. Withersq who had mislaid his hat under a
chair, and came to her to bid adieu.</p>

<p>“Thanks for coming and now you know the
way you must come again” said the Countess
hurrying up and tripping over some lace
hanging from her arms for she was in a sort of
dressing gown of pink silk “and wont you
come to my river party too?”</p>

<p>“Thanks yes I daresay I shall” said Selia as
a parting arrow stiffly and stalked out, Mr. Withersquash hurrying behind, but kissing his
hand to the company who smiled sweetly upon
him.</p>

<p>When they got in the car Selia sniffed a
good bit and tried to cry because she was sorry
for herself but she only managed a very little
tear, which Mr. Withersq wiped up for her.</p>

<p>“Do not cry” said he “for those silly cats.
They have nothing better to do but to try and
steal a little greatness from such as us. The
time will come for them to sue for your
<a name="png.127" id="png.127" href="#png.127"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>123<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>favors as they do mine and then we shall see.”
So she cheered up and made him go and buy
her a string of coloured beads too in a shop on
the way home, and when they got back she
departed to the Turkish baths to have a
massage for she would need all her strength in
the trial to come.</p>

<h2 title="Chapter Twelve"> </h2>
<div class="chapta">
<h3 title="">CHAPTER TWELVE
<a name="png.128" id="png.128" href="#png.128"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>124<span class="ns">]</span></span></a></h3>



<p class="drop-cap">The blue-coat chauffeur tucked Mr. Withersq and his Selia within the car
which spead on greased wheels of
lightning through the western of London and
out into the more rustical parts where there
were trees. Quick oh quick they moved and
Selia’s heart came in her mouth several times
with people and no small quantity of dogs
they shaved past.</p>

<p>Twilight had settled when they drew up
with a good toot on their grunty hooter at the
white wicker gate of the country home of the
Countess on the evening of the proper day as
they had somewhat artfully arranged only to
arrive in time for dinner.</p>

<p>As well as they could see squinting through
the darkness it was a very low house and very
<a name="png.129" id="png.129" href="#png.129"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>broad like a tennis club but of course more
grand looking very nice with nice smelling
flowers about and two white peacocks strolling
on the lawn. But alas to their dismay no one
was at home. Only a little page-boy and he
was a stuttering one, and had some trouble to
get out that the family was on the river in their
boat, so that Mr. Withersq gave him a sixpence
and let him go.</p>

<p>“Dear me” said he waving away the
chauffeur who took off the car, “we are nicely
sold and shall get no grub.”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed” said Selia very crossly “I
think we had better go home again” for she
had a vacancy.</p>

<p>“Not so” cried he “we have not come so far
for nothing. Come with me.”</p>

<p>Now Selia was more than a bit tired and
only followed him because she hoped to be fed
rebuffing his kindly arm, she tottered on her
high heels beside him in smothering rage.
<a name="png.130" id="png.130" href="#png.130"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>126<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>But past experiences had taught our hero.
“Fear not” he said “you will be well filled
yet, for Unckle Burt has not died for nothing.”</p>

<p>And he led her through the dark lanes
under the creepy trees towards the spottling
lights of a near village. Selia was a good bit
afraid as she feared to step on a frog or some
other vermin and went picking her way. Still
she had a pluck and kept moving only wishing
herself elsewhere.</p>

<p>Soon they struck a cosy little pub where a
man was hissing outside over the feet of a
horse which he was washing. Selia looked at
the horse which exchanged her glance but
Mr. Withersq looked in the pub. He came
out in a short moment to find his sweet
leaning against the animal.</p>

<p>“All is well,” said he, “our party is close at
hand.”</p>

<p>“Nasty lot they might have waited for us,”
<a name="png.131" id="png.131" href="#png.131"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>127<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>said she. “For I am footsore and have empty
rumblings also.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir,” said the horse’s man,
coming up under its stomach, “but there is a
nice little ham and beef shop a few doors
away.”</p>

<p>Casting a cold look on this fellow, Selia
took the talk up. “Show the gentleman the
way,” said she, “and pop me on the horse, for
I must have a sit down and do not care to demean
myself by entering a public house.”</p>

<p>The horse, hearing his name mentioned,
turned to have a stare, but she cared little for
that, knowing to be firm with the dumb creatures
is best, so she made a severe face at it.</p>

<p>“Show a leg,” cried Harold gallantly, and
with a good grasp on her, and the man pushing
too, they got her up on the horse.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” she said, getting comfortable,
and finding it a nice broad beast as she
had hoped. So Mr. Withersq and the man
<a name="png.132" id="png.132" href="#png.132"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>128<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>disapeared, leaving Selia bravely seated on
the steed, which champed its bit somewhat,
but every time it moved she cried “Whoo!”
and it obeyed her, to the surprise of some
yokels who peeked forth from the pub.
Before long Mr. Withersq<!-- original reads "Withers"  --> and the man came
back, the latter bearing some paper bags.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, I have food!” cried Harold, “and
I am feeling most poetical. This good man
will give you a lift on this horse to the Countess’s
boat, so off we go.”</p>

<p>At this the little procession set off, but first
Selia cried “Oh pray give me a bite for I am
perishing.” At this Mr. Withersq rustled in a
bag and drew forth a sandwich and passed it
up to her. So off they went in the darkness of
the night, Selia on the horse, and Mr. Withersq holding one of her feet to steady her,
while she chewed a rather mysterious sandwich,
not being able to see what it was, and
bumping a good bit on the heaving animal.
<a name="png.133" id="png.133" href="#png.133"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>129<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The horse’s man led the way down another
lane, followed by some rude cheers from the
pub. Before long they saw water, and in a
few moments drew a halt.</p>

<p>“Coo-ee!” howled the man.</p>

<p>From out a large, white place looming with
myriad twinkling lights an answering voice
cried “Coo-ee!”</p>

<p>“Is it another house?” said Selia. “I dont
see no boat.”</p>

<p>“It is the boat,” cried the horse’s man.</p>

<p>Lo! on the river’s edge was a great boat like
a steamer, bedecked with fairy lamps, and at
the sound of our hero’s arrival many voices
noised out and forms were seen on the deck.
Never had Selia beheld such a vision as this
grand boat.</p>

<p>“Well, it is just like a house,” cried she.</p>

<p>“It is a houseboat,” said Harold, “for I read
it up in an etiquette book.”</p>

<p>Oh how Selia laughed to hear this! “So
<a name="png.134" id="png.134" href="#png.134"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>130<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that is where all your stiff new ways come
from, is it!” jested she, though not so coyly as
she would, as her horse was sipping a little of
the river, and it was hard to sit on it so sloping.</p>

<p>“Ha, welcome!” the voice of the Countess
was then heard. “Come aboard, pray! We
were expecting you to supper, but still, better
late than never.”</p>

<p>So Selia dropped from the horse, jolting
herself a good bit, and together with Mr. Withersq mounted a small ladder from the
river’s edge up the side of this magnificent
boat, and so arrived safe on the deck, at which
a throng, bobbing up from all directions,
seized on them with merry hand shakings, and
cooings of delight, for they had been given up,
and their arrival proved a welcome diversion,
and Lipstick barked madly his eyes more
polished than ever. The Countess who was in
a tight dress of black beads sewn on stuff like
<a name="png.135" id="png.135" href="#png.135"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>131<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a serpent grasped warmly their hands and
seemed more glad than before for no doubt
their fame had spread more and so she
thought them worth her while.</p>

<p>“Let me introduce you to the folk” she said
kindly, motioning to the group of about six
behind her.</p>

<p>“This is the well-known Mr. Bross” she
continued picking on a pear-shaped gent with
plump legs in white trousers and a short
evening jacket, so he came up smiling with
blandness.</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you Mr. Poet” said he
and the Countess wispered to Selia “He is
rather an amusing man we have asked him
ten times before it is a pity he is nearly
finished.”</p>

<p>“How is that” said Selia bowing to him.</p>

<p>“Oh he is no good at much but foreign
langwages” said the Countess merrily, “and
he only knows fifteen. You see as he is not
<a name="png.136" id="png.136" href="#png.136"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>132<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>very high born we expect him to amuse us,
and he sings very well so he has to burst into
song after breakfast on Sundays to take away
the rather chilly feeling on Sunday mornings.
As he has already sung in ten different
langwages and of course we wouldn’t like the
same one twice, he only has five more weekends
to come.”</p>

<p>The langwage-singer sighed at this no
doubt overhearing, and gave way to a greyish-coloured
fellow reeking a little of wine.
“This is Mr. Panter, you must have heard of
him” said the Countess. “He makes reputations.”</p>

<p>“Is that so” said Selia who was keeping her
end up very well, “what does he make them
of?”</p>

<p>“Ah dear girl you do not understand”
simpered the other lady, “we always ask him
down for when one gets a bit stale of people
and they have not done anything in the way of
<a name="png.137" id="png.137" href="#png.137"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>133<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a stunt lately, he makes up such sweet little
stories about everyone that they become quite
nice again, and for some he makes up entire
reputations for a consideration, and they live
on them.”</p>

<p>“Oh I see” said Selia “it is a business.”</p>

<p>“Naturally” said the Countess kindly “for
they all want to live you know and as cats have
the artfulness to live by being cats and so
getting milk and meat, so many are compelled
to live by having reputations which causes
them to be asked about and fed. Mr. Panter
has the most magnificent set of offices near the
British Museum.”</p>

<p>“I must remember him” said Selia “he
might come in useful some day when we
want to be noticed.”</p>

<p>“Tush” twittered her friend “Mr. Panter
leaves ladys to look after their own reputations,
dont you sir?” and this remark drew a
laugh from a priestly looking damsel with
<a name="png.138" id="png.138" href="#png.138"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>134<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>many ropes of pearls about her elegant long
neck, lolling in a deckchair near their feet, so
Selia was now introduced to her and as well as
she could grasp this lady did nothing but be
an earl’s sister because of course if you are
nobel that is enough and saves many pains.</p>

<p>“I hear” said the earls sister who was most
languid and archy in her way of speaking and
holding herself, “that Mr. Bross is learning
Welsh.”</p>

<p>“Dear me” said Selia “now he will be able
to come again for another week-end more.”</p>

<p>“Certenly not” said the Countess proudly,
“this is not a political house-boat, we are
artists and I do not think we could bear Welsh
after breakfast even on Sundays. I must
speak to him and try to urge him to learn
something else.”</p>

<p>So she got up and went off to do so.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Withersq had rather sidled
away towards a nice little girl in a cream frock
<a name="png.139" id="png.139" href="#png.139"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>135<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>very low and fluffy, and had talked to her and
she had opened wide great eyes of amaze to
him to hear so great a poet speak ordinary.
He was now muttering something with many
muffled laughs to a very tall oldish man in a
suit of pearl grey silk, and munching a fish
sandwich which from time to time he dipped
in a glass of champagne he had had brought
him by a menial attired as a sailor.</p>

<p>From the chair in which she had sunk
Selia pawed at her Harold’s near trouser. So
he passed her down some food which she
wolfed up. Then as she was tired and could
not make out much of the various persons
around who were all smoking long cigarettes
and by their talk seemed to have endless little
private jokes of their own, she went off to bed,
which was down some steep brass-tipped
stairs with a rope bannister, into the bowels of
the boat. Imagine her surprise when she
<a name="png.140" id="png.140" href="#png.140"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>opened her room door to find Scrogg knitting
a sock within.</p>

<p>“Goodday” cried Scrogg springing up and
ready to unfasten her, and “Goodevening”
said Selia stifling her yawn with a smile “how
did ever you come here Scrogg?”</p>

<p>“I thought you would like me” said Scrogg
humbly, “so I came up the river in a little row-boat
I keep for emergencies.”</p>

<p>“I see” said Selia “that was very nice of
you I’m sure. I am very tired though.”</p>

<p>“No wonder madame” said the maid
throwing her pink Greecian nightdress over
her head nimbly, “with so many clever
people about, for the Countess only has the
first class cream at her boat parties.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah” cried Selia “what a funny
pillow!” and lo the bed she jumped in was
built to the wall like a real boat’s bed and her
pillow was like a life-buoy but made in
feathers with a white linen cover and frilled
<a name="png.141" id="png.141" href="#png.141"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>137<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with real lace. Scrogg then quickly fixed up a
hammock across the little room, under the
round window, and went to bed in it, and thus
to the sound of the slapping waves mistress
and maid snoozed while Mr. Withersq talked
of his poetry to the company on deck, still all
swigging champagne till the early hours.</p>

<p>Selia slept late next day for the fresh air
made her drowsy and only peeped out of her
bed in time to hear in the distance the loud
end of Mr. Bross’s Sunday morning song and
the applause after it. Scrogg then entered
with a tray of rolls and coffee.</p>

<p>“The Countess asked me to tell you the
song was a great success” she said with
her usual curtsey, “it was in Yiddish this
week.”</p>

<p>“Oh” said Selia rubbing her eyes up for the
day, “how clever!” for she unluckily did not
know where this was spoken. When she had
just finished up her breakfast a thunderous
<a name="png.142" id="png.142" href="#png.142"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>138<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>knock sounded on her door and Scrogg
opened.</p>

<p>“Dear me” said this good servant, for who
should stand there but Mr. Withersq in a
grand navy bathing costume embroidered
with anchors and wearing canvas boots. Selia
modestly hid in her bed.</p>

<p>“None of that now” said he “all is al fresco
here, so nip up. You will find a bathing
costume under the pillow, and I give you five
minutes.”</p>

<p>So with a good grin he withdrew leaving
Selia to spring up and quickly dress in the
dinky suit which as he had said she would find
under the lifebuoy pillow. She shrank a little
from the eyes of the men and also swanked a
bit too because of the Countess who was in a
pea-green suit, and the Earls sister in mauve
and the nice little girl in orange, but Selia was
all in black like Annette Kellermann.</p>

<p>“Hurrah” quoth she as she appeared and
<a name="png.143" id="png.143" href="#png.143"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>139<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>they all cheered also for Selia was indeed a fine
girl and Mr. Withersq patted his own back
and jumped for joy to see her, knocking over
a pot of flowers ornamenting the boat. The
water below sparkled and looked a bit cold,
the birds sang and the trees were nice and
green.</p>

<p>“One two three” said the Countess and at
three such a splash occurred as all the party
threw themselves recklessly into the water,
followed by Lipstick the dog. Selia felt happy
to find them flesh and blood after all and
Harold trod the water in glee. They all had a
merry sport, and Selia raced the gentleman
who had been in grey silk but now in striped
drawers, ending by ducking him.</p>

<p>When the swim was over they all climbed
very dripping on the deck to be received by
menials with hot towels and so away to their
rooms to dress, after which lunch arrived. It
was a splendid repast with salmon and not
<a name="png.144" id="png.144" href="#png.144"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>140<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>tinned either, and after lunch Mr. Withersq
recited a new poem he had made that very
day, which pleased them all very much and he
got a stamp from the Earls sister to post it to
the King, and Panter slapped him on the
shoulder and swore never to forget him.</p>

<p>True to their rule Mr. Withersq and Selia
prepared to depart early and amid much
goodbyes climbed over the side and down the
ladder to terra firma where their car awaited
them, and waved themselves off, while Scrogg
meanwhile was seen to get into her little boat
and soon vanished round the corner of the
water rowing hard.</p>

<p>As Selia sank back into the car with a parting
wave to the boat, Mr. Withersq caught
her in a firm kiss.</p>

<p>“Tush” she said “have done.” But she
was not so vexed as she seemed for she
loved him but of course she still had to be a
bit coy.</p>

<p><a name="png.145" id="png.145" href="#png.145"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>141<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“I think we are doing very well” said he
smacking his lips, and emerging a great cigar
from his pocket. “Bross gave me this and I
think he will consent to come to our parties
when we have a house.”</p>

<p>Selia blushed at his meaning glance at this
word, and then said “No doubt he will be glad
to dear Harold. And it will not be so long
now for next week I hope to show them the
stuff I am made of and have my photo in the
weekly papers, which is fame.”</p>

<p>So hand in hand with Mr. Withersq puffing
the big cigar they glided back to London and
their hotel.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">It is now the folowing Saterday.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the brothers Majpottel had
not been idel for they had wangeled it as
well as they could, dropped a hint here and a
word there in the usuel way and kept expectations
up to<!-- TN: original reads "to to" --> scratch for the great day of
Selia’s tussel with fate, and this was to come off
that very after noon.</p>

<p>Selia was lying on her second floor at the
Grand Palace and being swilled down by a lot
of ladys and girls that had come round to look
after her like boxers are done to, and they
rubbed and slapped and jumped her about and
flipped her with towels and squooshed water
on her till her arms were as hard as nails and
so were her legs too which was lucky as in
tennis you want both.</p>

<p><a name="png.147" id="png.147" href="#png.147"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>143<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
When they had done with her they helped
her to dress and pouder and then attended her
like handmaids to the taxi that was waiting, as
Mr. Withersquash had bought one for her to
use. Mr. Withersq who was now wearing the
special poets badge in his coat was waiting for
her.</p>

<p>“My hour has come” she wispered to him,
she felt a bit bad inside at the idear. “Have
pluck” he wispered back “and then we can
get married!”</p>

<p>So off she drove to Lords which is a large
park so called because all the nuts go there to
see the games going on. When they got there
there was a dense throttling crowd and they
went in and had a look round to get their
breath before starting. Where they had got
to was the wrong part among the crowd so
they pushed on through to the socierty part.
Selia was arrayed in a cordion pleeted white
robe with shoes and stockings to match and
<a name="png.148" id="png.148" href="#png.148"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>144<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Mr. Withersq wore his best day suit and shiny
topper in fine stile and all made way for them
with murmurs of praise so on they stept very
saucy.</p>

<p>When they came to the socierty part which
had a rope round and went to go in an haughty
dame sniffled over them and would have
stopped them specially Selia.</p>

<p>“And pray what are you up to my good
girl?” said she very nasty, but just then their
old friend the admiral came leaping up now
in a white garb, and said:</p>

<p>“Way for the Head Poet and Lady!”</p>

<p>So the haughty dame had to make way and
felt very sore put down no doubt.</p>

<p>After shaking hands with the admiral they
stept on to where the King and Queen had just
arrived and said goodday to them which drew
a cry of surprise from all present to see them
so well known by the Highest in the Land.</p>

<p>His Magesty called out,</p>

<p><a name="png.149" id="png.149" href="#png.149"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>145<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“The Lady Selia wants to beat the world
with her skill at tennis. Who will take her
on?”</p>

<p>And Rupert and Gerald Majpottel now
came tripping up and cried “Hi! This way
for the lady tennis champions! Anyone
want to try their strength? Walk up and
try to beat the Lady Selia!” This made the
company laugh very harty to hear the
brothers go on in this way, which was their
little joke and did a lot of good. For the head
lady tennis players who had been lounging
idly in chairs behind the King and Queen now
sprang fiercely forward on hearing this cry of
the Majpottels and said “Here we are!” and
there were three of them.</p>

<p>Meantime the crowd was crowding something
awful all round the socierty part and
staring and the newspaper men were taking
photos and scribbling in books about it. Oh
what a moment! Almost for a tick Selia
<a name="png.150" id="png.150" href="#png.150"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>146<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wished Mr. Withersquashes Unckle Burt had
never passed away, but then girding herself
up, and blushing a little at the roar of cheers
that rose when the crowd saw that she was a
sport, she tossed off her hat with a proud toss,
and summoned for a bat.</p>

<p>“Come on then!” she yelled to the head lady
tennis players.</p>

<p>“Not so fast!” cried the Queen kindly “for
there are three to one against which we all
know is wrong.”</p>

<p>So one of the three head tennis ladys who
all had medals on their chests because of all
the games they had won, said she would take
sides with Selia. And some of the socierty
folks snigered and said “tosh” for they did not
know Selia and bemeaned her being as they
well knew only humbel of birth for she had got
her name up owing to having got on so lately.</p>

<p>Out on the grassy sward she stept swashing
her tennis bat while Mr. Withersquash
fondly gazed on her from beside royalty.</p>

<p><a name="png.151" id="png.151" href="#png.151"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>147<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Pom!” the game began and a ball came
over. And “pom!” Selia hit it back and so she
went on. Nothing could get past her. Oh
she was very clever at tennis was Selia though
her light had hitherto been under a bushel.</p>

<p>Love thirty, love forty, game, so it went on
and on for ages, and then when at the last the
lady partner playing with Selia got a bit waxy
because she never had a chance to touch a ball
and began grumbling, Selia took her on too
and smashed her although she was on the
same side of the net, and smashed the two
ladys on the other side and smashed them all
and they could hardly stand they were so tired
and cross.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, hurrah” cried Mr. Withersquash
from the socierty part, and the King and
Queen stood up to have a better look and the
crowd roared and the brothers Majpottel fell
on each others necks and cried very loud and
wet for joy they were so glad and in fact it
was a proper sight you never saw the like of
<a name="png.152" id="png.152" href="#png.152"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>148<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>until at last Selia threw up her tennis bat in
the air and cried very loud:</p>

<p>“Have you had enough?”</p>

<p>And the two lady players on the other side
of the net and the one lady partner who had
also been beaten although a partner said all
together: “Yes!” and casting down the medals
from off their dishonorable bosoms they slunk
away and were seen no more and Selia was left
triumphant on the field which was a neat little
plot of green amidst all the cheering multitude,
and the Queen bekoned and she went
back up into the socierty part, hanging her
head with modesty.</p>

<p>“Cheers” said the King kindly as she strode
up, and the Queen took her hand and patted
it and said “You are made of good stuff my
dear and will make a good man happy” at
which she made a meaning sign to Mr. Withersq.</p>

<p>With a deep blush Selia slopped into his
<a name="png.153" id="png.153" href="#png.153"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>149<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>arms and he placed a kiss on her lip at which
all present cried aloud and smiled and were
delited to see a romance of the kind.</p>

<p>“I hereby announce that my Head Poet
and his young lady Selia are engaged” then
said the King stroking his beard and he was
the first to shake hands with the honorable
and lucky Harold.</p>

<p>Just then a page boy stepped up with a
great bouquet in his hands which he laid at
Selia’s feet. So Mr. Withersq gave him a bob
and on the bouquet was a little label saying
“With all good wishes from the boys” so Selia
knew she had not been forgot by her old
friends.</p>

<p>And now let us take leave of Mr. Withersq
with his Selia in his arms surrounded by
royalty and the flower of England’s socierty,
he the Head Poet and she the Queen of Sport.
For what more could their hearts desire?</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
